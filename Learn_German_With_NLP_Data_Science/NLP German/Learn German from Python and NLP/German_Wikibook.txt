3 Introduction
A Textbook on Five Levels
The question arose early in the development of this textbook as to precisely who would be
the target audience.  Although intended to be a "beginning" textbook on German, many
felt that the early lessons were too difficult for younger students with very limited or no
experience with German and, perhaps more importantly, limited skills in English grammar.
For this reason a textbook on three levels was conceived.  Beginning German1  (Level I)
puts more emphasis on building vocabulary around subject matter interesting and useful
to young students. Basic German2 (Level II) emphasises grammar, and assumes a greater
knowledge of English grammar more typical of an older high school or a college student.
If you are just beginning to learn German or attempting to teach yourself, you may wish
to try both approaches and see which works better for you, since some people require a
strong structural approach to learning a new language while others find this "structure"
only impedes progress by adding another layer of complexity. Intermediate German3 (Level
III), which requires even more knowledge of English, is for college students, preferably for
sophomores or juniors. With even more complex lessons, grammar and vocabulary comes
Advanced German4  (Level IV), which with the most complex and difficult parts of the
German language, is for late college students (Seniors) and college graduates. The last level,
which is a review level, but also has cultural facts and the history of the German language,
is Reviewed German.5  (Level V). An existing, separate text, German/Grammar6, may
eventually be merged into the lesson modules or developed into useful appendices as a
grammar reference.  At present, however, German Grammar is an expanding, significant
contribution to the textbook; it provides an important reference on German language gram-
mar rules useful to the student working through any of the three levels.
3.1 The German Language
German (Deutsch) is a member of the western group of the Germanic language7s.  It is
spoken primarily in Germany, Austria, the majority of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Lux-
embourg, the Südtirol (South Tyrol) region of Italy, the Opole Voivodship of Poland, the
eastern part of Belgium, parts of Romania, the Alsace (Elsass) region of France and parts
of Denmark.  Additionally, several former colonial possessions of these countries, such as

Introduction
Namibia in Africa, have sizable German-speaking populations. There are German-speaking
minorities in several eastern European countries including Russia, and in the United States
as well as countries in South America like Brazil, Argentina and Chile.  Over 120 million
people speak German as their native language. German is the third most popular foreign
language taught worldwide, and the second most popular in Europe.  Continue reading
about the German language8.
3.2 German and English
If you are an English speaker unfamiliar with German, you may be surprised to learn that
English and German are closely related languages and share many words that are very
similar.  Such words are called cognate9s.  This is particularly true for everyday words in
English that are Anglo-Saxon (that is, Germanic) in origin.                                   Consider the following list of
English words followed by their German counterparts:
arm ˜ der Arm
book ˜ das Buch
cat ˜ die Katze
father ˜ der Vater
finger ˜ der Finger
wagon ˜ der Wagen
house ˜ das Haus
hand ˜ die Hand
June ˜ der Juni
man ˜ der Mann
mother ˜ die Mutter
mouse ˜ die Maus
name ˜ der Name
son ˜ der Sohn
garden ˜ der Garten

Some German words have the same origin as their English counterparts but the meaning
has changed:
worry = würgen (strangle)
kind = das Kind (child)
• Audio: OGG10 (308KB) ˜ Hear these words
Of course, even words whose spelling is no different in English and German may be pro-
nounced quite differently.  But in reading German, you will see the connections between
these languages, even in many of the "small" words (the above examples are all nouns). For
example:
This week, my father is with my brother in the city.
Diese Woche ist mein Vater mit meinem Bruder in der Stadt.
• Audio: OGG11 (87KB) ˜ Hear these sentences
Note also the general similarity of sentence structure with English. The only real difference
in the German is that the verb is moved forward in the sentence. However, there are many
German sentences in which a verb form is the last word in the sentence.
Unfortunately,  while German is perhaps the easiest "foreign" language for an English
speaker to learn, meanings of words that are spelled similarly are not always identical.
These "false friends12" can be confusing for the beginner. Further, German is a more struc-
tured language than English, with a more complex grammar, and it will become apparent
as you learn German that you will also learn more about English language structure than
you might ever recall from your high school English classes. For a quick listing of similarities
and differences between English and German, read the Introduction to Level I13.
3.3 Vocabulary and Grammar
In learning to read or speak any language with which you have minimal acquaintance (that
is, are not a native speaker of), the two aspects to be mastered are vocabulary and grammar.
Acquiring vocabulary is a "simple" matter of memorization. For the language(s) we learn

Introduction
as children, this process is so transparent that we have trouble conceiving of the importance
of having a large vocabulary.  By the age of conscious recognition of our communicating
with others through speech, we have already learned the meaning of thousands of words.
Even words we have trouble defining, we readily understand their use in conversation. This
process can be "reactivated," as it were, by immersion in a second language: a method of
learning a new language by moving to a place where that language is spoken and having to
get around and live without use of one's native tongue.
The student of German language, if not residing in a German-speaking environment, must
put forth substantial effort to learning words, including their meaning, their pronunciation
and their usage in common sentences. Be sure to "learn"—commit to memory—all of the
vocabulary words in each lesson as they are presented. Early lessons have simple sentences
because it is assumed that the student's vocabulary is limited.  But throughout the text,
more complex discourses (often as photo captions) are included to introduce the student
to regular German in use.  It may be helpful to translate these using a German-English
dictionary (access to one is a must; see Appendix 514  for on-line options).  Other sources
of German, such as newspapers, magazines, web sites, etc., can also be useful in building
vocabulary and developing a sense of how German words are put together. The  German
Wikipedia15  provides an ever expanding source of German language articles that can be
used for this purpose.  Further, a German version of the Wikibooks project—a library of
textbooks in German—is available at  German Wikibooks16.
German grammar is more complex than, but sufficiently similar to, English that "reading"
German is possible with minimal vocabulary in the sense that the student should generally
recognize the parts of a sentence. With a good dictionary or an online translator, an English
speaker can usually translate a German sentence close to correctly. However, to accurately
speak and understand German, you must learn how each word functions in a sentence.
There are eight basic grammatical functions:  case, gender, number, tense, person,
mood, voice, and comparison.  How words "signal" these functions is an important
aspect of learning a new language. English speakers should know all of these functions and
the signals used in English, but it is often the situation that you know perfectly well how
to speak English, without understanding much about word-functions and signals. For this
reason, this textbook incorporates considerable detail on grammar, including both English
and German grammar.  The reference book English17  at Wikibooks may be consulted for
additional help. When we say German is more complex than English, what we really mean
is that the signals used in German are different from and more numerous than those used
by English.
3.4 Pronunciation
A guide to the pronunciation18  of German is provided.  You should become familiar with
this page early on, and refer to it often.  Nothing can replace learning a language from
14                                                                                              Chapter 88 on page 341

Layout of Lessons
a native speaker, but the text is liberally sprinkled with audio files providing the student
with valuable input from hearing spoken German. Analyze the spoken words carefully. The
pronunciation guide can only closely, not exactly, convey how German words should be
pronounced. And of course, German (like English) has a number of dialects distinguished
by differences in pronunciation.
Help in the pronunciation of individual words can be found by accessing the sound files of
either of the online dictionaries, links to which are given in the German websites19 appendix.
3.5 Layout of Lessons
This textbook is intended as a beginning course in the German language for English speak-
ers. Early lessons emphasize conversational subjects and gradually introduce German gram-
matical concepts and rules.  In addition, sound files accompany appropriate parts of each
lesson. Although the basic lessons (Grundlegende Lektionen) are presented at about the
(US) high school level, beginners (including those attempting to learn German outside of
a course structure) are expected to work through several basic lessons up to an indicated
point, when review is suggested along with additional study. The basic way lessons go to
other lessons is very simple and direct:
• Lesson 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > and on to the end of the text.
3.6 Layout within Lessons
The following subheadings or categories are offered within the lessons (Level II and above):
1. One or more conversation (Gespräch) or story (Geschichte) pieces in German alone
to illustrate the language in use.
2. Study material (Lernen) in English and German to present lists of conceptually
related words.
3. One or more grammar (Grammatik) lessons covering elements of German grammar,
with illustrations drawn from the conversation, story, or study materials.
4. A list of words (Vokabeln) and phrases introduced in the lesson, above that point,
usually in the conversation, story, or study presentations.  Words and phrases are
arranged alphabetically within groups, and the groups are presented in the following
order: 1) nouns, 2) phrases, 3) verbs, and 4) all other words. A guide to pronunciation
of the words presented is consolidated within Appendix 120. However, in each Voka-
beln, nouns stressed on other than the first syllable (the general rule in German) are
indicated by bolding of the stressed syllable (e.g., Biologie).  Note that the English
translation of all German words in a Vokabeln is the best equivalent for the lesson
example. The lesson Vokabeln is not a dictionary, but a quick reference for translation
purposes.  For this reason, verbs are not translated into a typical English infinitive
form with a preceding particle, "to".

20                                                                                               Chapter 84 on page 325

Introduction
5. A list of additional, related words or phrases (Andere Wörter; advanced lessons
only) that relate to, but are not included in, the vocabulary presented in the basic
and advanced lessons.
6. English sentences and other material to be translated by the student into German
(Übersetzung). These are numbered and a matching answer sheet is linked to this
category.  The student should write out the German using material from the lesson
(and previous lessons) before checking their work against the answer list.
3.7 The Student and the Lesson
Each level of the text is designed to constitute a course of study in the German language. For
any level selected, each lesson should be read thoroughly and mastered before moving on.
Substantial text in German is included and the student should read all of it, not once, but
multiple times. At Levels II and III, complete translations into English are included only in
selected places. Most of this text must be translated by the student using his or her acquired
vocabulary and the vocabulary presented at the bottom of each lesson. As the German text
is read (preferably out loud), the student must succeed in gaining an understanding of the
meaning of each sentence, and of the role each word plays in establishing that meaning. To
the beginner, there will seem to be many words in a German sentence that are out of place
or even redundant or unnecessary.  These add subtleties to the language that will make
sense eventually. But it is important to experience these subtleties from the very beginning.

6 Lesson 1.00 - Introduction
I.0: Introduction
Welcome to Level I German!
Level I is aimed at junior high and high school students. However, it can also be used by
others just beginning to learn to speak or read German.
The goal of Level I German is to introduce the basics of the German language without
overwhelming students. Therefore, the vocabulary is formatted for translating from English
(which the students know) into German.
Although Level II is aimed at students and people who are a bit proficient after Level I,
still, English translation will be used, so as to ease the learning. It helps because, at times
while learning a new language, even with basic understanding, the words are above normal
understanding level, and thus require a "sub" assistance.
6.1 German and English
German and English are quite close to each other, and are called language sisters or, more
formally, cognate languages.  Both belong to the Germanic branch of the Indo-European
language family. Here are some major similarities:
• Both languages use the Latin alphabet.
• Normally, sentences follow Subject-Verb-Object order.
• Questions have Verb-Subject-Object order or Adverb-Verb-Subject-Object order.
• There are contractions (e.g., isn't) in both German and English.
• Many words share the same roots, such as word and Wort, or house and Haus.
• Many words are spelled almost the same way in English and German; for example, Text,
Zoo, Handball, Motor, Bus, Park, Position, or Garage.
• Kindergarten (early school grade) is an English word borrowed directly from German,
with a slight change of meaning from its original sense of daycare or nursery school.
As you can see, German is quite similar to English. There are, however, differences:
• German has more letters than and different pronunciations from English.
• In German the verb is sometimes the last word of a sentence.
• German has more verb forms than English.
• German is the only known written language where every noun is capitalized, whether or
not it is a proper noun.
• The word ich (I) is only capitalized if it is the first word of the sentence.
17

Lesson 1.00 - Introduction
• German has three different words for you.
• Adjectives have different endings based on the noun they are modifying in German.
• German does not have any Present Continuous tense, only Present tense.
However, German is still one of the easiest languages for English speakers to learn.  The
differences will be tackled over the course of the lessons.
6.2 How to Use this Level of the German Textbook
The lessons are meant to be taken in order. You should read and review the German dialogs
as often as possible.  Many of the dialogs come with audio recordings by native speakers.
These recordings are invaluable to learn the German pronunciation. If there is a recording,
you can do several kinds of exercises:
• Read the German dialog and translate it to English with the help of the vocabulary list.
• Listen to the dialog while you read it and try to understand as much as possible.
• Listen to the dialog without reading it, pause the playback after each sentence and trans-
late it to English.
• Listen to the dialog without reading it, pause the playback after each sentence, and write
it down in German.
• Listen to the dialog while reading it, stop after each sentence and repeat the pronuncia-
tion.
At the reviews, after every third lesson, you go back to look at the previous lessons.
6.2.1 Layout of the Lessons
• Every lesson has a title at the top.
• The lesson will introduce several topics, more and more as the lessons progress.
• Topics are usually introduced by dialogs, which are accompanied by vocabulary lists.
• Each lesson features several problems and a test at the end. You should write down your
answers (either electronically or on paper) before looking at the suggested answers. The
act of writing down your answers will help you to learn the spelling.
• Level I uses a "more than enough" system for the problems. You don't have to do all of
the problems if you think you know the material. However, the test may require knowing
certain vocabulary, so you need to make sure you know it.
6.2.2 Levels of Completion
On the contents page, you will see filled-in boxes next to each lesson. The number of boxes
corresponds to the completeness of the lesson as follows:

Figure 5
Lesson I.1: Wie heißt du? (1. Teil)
This lesson deals with basic conversation topics such as saying hello and goodbye and asking
people how they are feeling.  This lesson features audio recordings by native speakers to
help you with the pronunciation.
8.1 Dialogue
Read and listen to the following dialogue between two students:  Franz and Greta.  You
don't have to understand anything!  You should rather try to find out how each word is
pronounced.
Franz                                                                                          Hallo, ich bin Franz. Wie heißt du?

Greta                                                                                            Wiedersehen!
UNKNOWN TEMPLATE German/Exercise
Listen carefully! The German pronunciation of many letters is similar to the English pro-
nunciation, but there are also many differences.  Try to answer the following question by
listening carefully. Write your answers on a piece of paper or in a text file before you check
them.
1. How is the "a" in "Hallo", "Franz", "Greta", "ja", "danke", and "dann" pronounced?
2. How is the "i" in "ich" and "bis" pronounced?
3. How is the "ch" in "ich" pronounced?
4. How is the "z" in "Franz" pronounced?
5. How is the "w" in "wie", "Weiß" and "wiedersehen" pronounced?
6. How is the "ie" in "wie" and "Wiedersehen" pronounced?
7. How is the "ei" in "heißt", "heiße" and "Weiß" pronounced?
8. How is the "ß" in "heißt", "heiße" and "Weiß" pronounced?
9. How is the "e" in "es", "kennst", "er" and "Herr" pronounced?
10. How is the first "e" in "gehen", "Greta", and "geht" pronounced?
1. Similar to the "a" in "hard".
2. Similar to the "i" in "hit".
3. Similar to, but not entirely like, the "ch" in the Scottish word "Loch".  The sound
does not exist in English.
4. "z" is pronounced like "ts".
5. Similar to the "v" in "vat".
6. Similar to the "ee" in "meet".
7. "ei" is pronounced like "ai" in German or like the "i" in the English word "time".
8. "ß" is pronounced like "s".
9. Similar to "e" in "pet".
10. This is a long German "e"; the sound doesn't exist in English. It is between the "i"
in "hit" and the "e" in "pet".
Now try to understand the dialogue with the help of the following list of vocabulary.            (A
complete translation is given in the answers to the next problems.)

*You will need to know each expression with an asterisk (*) after it. The others, of course,
would be useful to know if you are traveling to regions where they are used. (As you can
see, the different German-speaking regions often have their own ways of saying hello and
goodbye. However, you will not be required to know any of these less common phrases for
any problems or tests.)
The more formal phrases are guten Morgen, guten Tag, and auf Wiedersehen.  The less
formal ones are tschüss, Tag, servus, and ciao.  The others are somewhat neutral on the
formal-informal scale.

8.3 Mr. and Mrs.
In German, Herr and Frau are used instead of Mr. and Mrs. before a last name; e.g., Mr.
Schwarz - Herr Schwarz.
English                                                                                        German
Mr.                                                                                            Herr
Mrs.                                                                                           Frau
Frau is used for married and unmarried women.  Some people still use Miss - Fräulein
in spoken German but it is no longer used in written German since it is considered an
inappropriate discrimination of unmarried women.
Literally, der Herr means the gentleman and die Frau means the woman. If you use these
words without a last name after them, you have to use an article before them; e.g., der Herr
or die Frau. This is actually just like in English. For example:
• The woman's name is Mrs. Weiß - Die Frau heißt Frau Weiß.
Note also that the German translation of the man is der Mann and the lady should be
translated to die Dame. Thus, without last names you would rather use these pairs:
• man and woman - Mann und Frau
• men and women - Männer und Frauen
• lady and gentleman - Dame und Herr
• ladies and gentlemen - Damen und Herren

Lesson I.4: Freizeit
9.1 Dialogue
Literally, Freizeit means free time, i.e., spare time.  In this dialogue, Franz and Greta are
familiarizing each other with their sports activities.
Franz                                                                                           Hallo, Greta! Wie spät ist es?

9.3 Spielen, Machen and Other Verbs
All three verbs that you were introduced to in Lesson 2 are irregular in some way; however,
most verbs are regular verbs.  In English, the regular conjugation is very easy:  only for
the third person singular an "-s" is added to the infinitive ("to see" becomes "he/she/it
sees").  Unfortunately, there are more endings in German.  The following two tables show
the endings for the two regular verbs spielen (to play) and machen (to do; to make):

Spielen, Machen and Other Verbs
As you see, the endings are the same for corresponding forms of spielen and machen.  In
fact, they are the same for all regular verbs. Thus, you can always just remove the -en from
the infinitive of a regular German verb to form the stem (e.g., spielen becomes spiel- and
machen becomes mach-) and then add the ending for the particular person. Here is a table
with these endings:

Spielen, Machen and Other Verbs
*The form for you (polite) — Sie is exactly the same as for the plural, 3rd person pronoun
they — sie.
9.3.1 Examples
• Was machst du?
What are you doing?
• Ich spiele Basketball.
I'm playing basketball.
• Spielst du Fußball?
Do you play soccer?
• Ich mache Hausaufgaben.
I'm doing homework.
• Er macht Hausaufgaben.
He's doing homework.
• Machst/Treibst du Sport?
Do you play sports?
Note that in English one plays sport, while in German one does sport. You can also use the
question words from Lesson 32 to form more combinations:
• Warum spielst du Baseball?
Why do you play baseball?
• Wann machst du die Hausaufgaben?
When do you do the/your homework?
To say "not", use "nicht". "Nicht" goes after the verb but before the sport.
• Wer spielt nicht Fußball?
Who doesn't play soccer?
• Wir spielen nicht Tennis.
We don't play tennis.

Both German and English have compound sentences; the applications of these are enormous.
They can be used in lists and also in compound sentences. For example,
• Ich spiele Basketball und er spielt auch Basketball.
I play basketball, and he also plays basketball.
The new word, also — auch is very important. The one grammar rule about auch is that
it always comes after the verb.

(to) swim                                                                                        schwimmen
                                                                                                 Schauen, schreiben and schwimmen are all regular verbs; i.e., they follow regular conjuga-
                                                                                                 tions. To conjugate them, you first remove the -en from the infinitive to form the stem (i.e.,
                                                                                                 schau-, schreib-, and schwimm-), and then add the correct ending. Here is an example:
verb (infinitive)                                                                                first step (stem)                                                                                conjugated form
schauen                                                                                          schau-                                                                                           ich schaue
Arbeiten is an irregular verb; however, it has a simple change. Whenever the ending starts
with a consonant, an -e- is added before it. For example, du arbeitest (not du arbeitst). As
well as er/sie/es/ihr arbeitet (not er/sie/es/ihr arbeitt).
Lesen is also an irregular verb. For the second and third person singular the form is liest,
i.e., du/er/sie/es liest (not du lesst).
Sehen is the last irregular verb. The second person singular is du siehst and the third person
singular is er/sie/es sieht.

Expressing likes and dislikes
9.3.4 Two More Verb Forms
There are two common verb forms in English that just don't exist in German: the ing-form
(or: present progressive); e.g., "I am playing" or "he is making"; and forms with "to do";
e.g., "I do play" or "he does not play".
The simple rule is: these constructions don't exist in German. Thus, you should translate I
am playing to ich spiele. Similarly, I do play is also translated to ich spiele. Anything else
(ich mache spielen or ich bin spielen) is either not possible in German or has a different
meaning.
The phrase I do not play should be translated to ich spiele nicht (literally: I play not) since
nicht (not) comes usually after the verb. This may sound like Early Modern English in a
play by Shakespeare, and this is no coincidence since German and English are both West
Germanic languages.

What do you like to do?                                                                           Was machst du gern*?
I like to play.                                                                                   Ich spiele gerne*.
What do you like to play?                                                                         Was spielst du gerne*?
I like to play soccer.                                                                            Ich spiele gerne* Fußball.
* gern and gerne can be used interchangeably.
In German, there are several ways to express likes and dislikes; this is just one of them.
You can also add other verbs for other activities, e.g., I like to read. — Ich lese gern. or I
like to work. — Ich arbeite gern. or I like to watch TV. — Ich schaue gern Fernsehen.
To express preference, you can use lieber instead of gern.  For example, I prefer to play
basketball. — Ich spiele lieber Basketball. or I prefer to read. — Ich lese lieber.
To express favorite activities, you can use am liebsten (meaning most of all) instead of lieber
or gern. For example, Most of all, I like to play chess. — Ich spiele am liebsten Schach.
To express dislikes, you can use nicht gern instead of gern, for example I don't like to swim.
— Ich schwimme nicht gern. or I don't like to work. — Ich arbeite nicht gern. or I don't
like to play soccer. — Ich spiele nicht gern Fußball.

9.5 Numbers
Numbers are among the most important and most useful words:  we need them to talk
about time, amounts, money, etc. Even if you are "just" a tourist, you often cannot avoid
numbers. Learning numbers can be a bit of a pain; thus, here is some advice: whenever you
have time, count something in German; e.g., steps, cars, people, seconds, whatever:         just
count.

*Some numbers are missing in the audio recording.
**Some people sometimes say zwo instead of zwei in order to distinguishing it more clearly
from drei (three), especially on the phone.
Notice the pattern: -teen translates to -zehn, and -ty to -zig.
There is one big problem with the numbers: in German the unit position comes before the
tens and is connected by und (and). For example: twenty-three — dreiundzwanzig (literally:
threeandtwenty), twenty-four — vierundzwanzig, thirty-five — fünfunddreißig, forty-six —
sechsundvierzig, etc.
One exception is eins which becomes ein- in 21, 31, 41, etc.: twenty-one — einundzwanzig
(literally: oneandtwenty), thirty-one — einunddreißig, forty-one — einundvierzig, etc.
German is not the only language with this "reverse" order of numbers:  Danish (another
Germanic language) and Arabic do it the same way.  This was also the standard way of
forming numbers in older versions of English ("Four and twenty blackbirds/Baked in a pie."
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sing_a_Song_of_Sixpence).

10 What's On the Test
To go straight to the lesson test, go here1.
The test will have four parts to it: Grammar (79 points), Translating (95 points), Reading
Comprehension (20 points), Vocabulary (20 points), and Previous Topics (10 points) in that
order. The Grammar section will test your ability to know the verbs from this lesson and
it's various versions, to know articles - the genders of them and the correct usage of them,
and correct word order.
The Translating section is worth the most points, and it too has three sections. You must
know the translations for sentences and phrases going from English to German, and be able
to take a German dialogue and translate it back into English.  Also you must know the
translation from Numbers to German.
The third section, Reading Comprehension, is Comprehension Questions you must know
how to read the conversion and after reading you will be asked question on the previous
conversion.
The fourth section is a vocabulary section.  You get 20 English words on the left and 20
German words on the right, and be asked to match them. To study for that, check out the
401 flashcards related to this lesson at  FlashcardExchange.com2 Part I and  FlashcardEx-
change.com3 Part II.
The last section, Previous Topics, is a quick review on Lesson 14 to get ready for this section,
just look at some past notes or go to Lesson 15 and study. That is the whole test. Take it!6

Franz                    Hallo, Greta! Wie geht's?
Greta                    Sehr gut. Ich habe Hunger.
Franz                    Ich auch. Möchtest du etwas essen?
Greta                    Ja!
                         In der Gaststätte
Greta                    Ich möchte Salat, Brot und Wasser.
Franz                    Hast du jetzt keinen Hunger?
Greta                    Doch, ich habe großen Hunger. Was bekommst du?
Franz                    Ich bekomme ein Stück Apfelstrudel und einen Eisbecher.
Greta                    Warum das? Du sollst eine Bratwurst nehmen.
Franz                    Nein, ich bin zufrieden. Ich habe keinen großen Hunger.
Greta                    Ach so, dann ist das genug.

11.3 Accusative Case
As you know from the introduction2, in German, there are four cases.  Three are used
often. The first, Nominative Case, you learned in Lesson 13. It covers the subject4, and
the predicate noun (in "He is (noun).", (noun) is the predicate noun).  The second, the
Accusative Case, you will learn now. It covers the direct object5 and the object of several
prepositions6. The third, the Dative Case will be taught later on. It covers the indirect
object7 and the object of many other prepositions.
The object of a sentence will be in accusative case.  In, "You hurt me.", 'me' would be
accusative.
Note: The Accusative Case and Dative Case are identical in English; that's why German
has one case extra.

Indefinite Article                                                                               einen       eine       ein      -eine*
* The indefinite article for plurals is non-existent.  However related words, such as
possessives and the kein- words that you will learn later this lesson, will end in einefor
plurals.
In the articles, the memory hook for accusative case is "Der goes to den (pronounced "dane"
UNKNOWN TEMPLATE audio
De-den.oggaudio
) and the rest stays the same." The masculine indefinite article goes to einen, and everything
else stays the same there. Therefore above, der Hamburger goes to den Hamburger and ein
Hamburger goes to einen Hamburger when the hamburger is the direct object, such as in
"Er hat einen Hamburger." ("He has a hamburger.")
If you are getting confused, it's fine. This topic is one of the hardest for English speakers
to grasp. Here are some solutions:
To find out the case of something, first find the verb.  The verb rules the sentence.  Ev-
erything revolves around it. Next you find the subject of the sentence. The subject is the
thing/person that is doing the verb. The subject is always in the Nominative Case,
so it takes on the der, die, das, die, or ein, eine, ein.
Now you look back at the verb.  If it is a being verb (am, are, is, etc.), the next noun
after the verb is the predicate noun.  An easy way to figure this out is to write an
equation. If the verb can be replaced with an equals sign (=), then the following noun is a
predicate noun. If it can't be replaced by an equals sign, refer to the next paragraph. The
predicate noun is also always in the Nominative Case, so the same rules apply
to it.
Ich bin ein Junge.
Sie ist eine Frau.
If the verb of the sentence is an action verb (playing, throwing, making, eating), find what
the subject is doing the verb to.  For example, if the verb is "makes" (macht), you look
for what is being made. That is the direct object. The direct object is always in the
Accusative Case, so it takes on the den, die, das, die, or einen, eine, ein.
Sie haben den Cheeseburger.
Habt ihr einen Salat?
The indefinite articles, when you just look at their endings, select e, -, e for nominative
case, and en, e, -, e for accusative.

Lesson 1.03 - Essen
Remember, between nominative and accusative, the only third-person change is in the
masculine form.
Section Problems8 >>
11.3.2 Pronouns
The pronouns experience a much bigger change than the articles.  This is also true in
English, as the articles (a, an, the) do not change ever, but I goes to me, we goes to us, etc.
Not everything is the same, though. While me is mich and us is uns, the second and third
persons undergo different changes.  In third person, as in the articles, the only change is
in masculine singular.  Following the "der goes to den" rule, er goes to ihn when in the
accusative case.
The second person in English never changes. In German, du goes to dich and ihr goes to
euch. Sie, the formal version of either, stays the same. Remember, Sie (2nd person formal)
and sie (3rd person plural) only differ in their meanings and the fact that the former is
capitalized and the latter is not. This stays true throughout German grammar.
Here is a tabular representation of the above.

11.3.3 Antecedents
Note: This is just a quick lesson in English grammar applied into German. If you already
know all about antecedents in English, skip the first paragraph.
When using a pronoun, you have to know what it is for it to work.  There are some rare
exceptions, such as in mysteries or drama, but otherwise this is always true. Sometimes in
dialogue this is taken care of by pointing or making some other gesture, but most of the time,
the pronoun modifies something already mentioned.  The object/person mentioned
earlier that turns into a pronoun later is called the antecedent.
In German this is very useful.  You can't simply say 'it' any more.  Many food words are
masculine and feminine, and when you turn them into pronouns, they turn into 'he', 'she',
'him', and 'her', not always 'it'. For example, the sentence "The cheeseburger tastes good.
It's very crunchy." turns into "The cheeseburger tastes good.  He's very crunchy." Note:
You will learn how to say this in German later in this lesson.
Why is it "he"? This is where the antecedent comes in. Because there are foods that are
masculine and feminine in German, you can't assume the 'es'. You have to look back at the
previous sentence, at the antecedent, der Cheeseburger. "Der Cheeseburger" is replaced by
er (since it is the subject, and therefore in Nominative Case).  Therefore, all you need to
know are these connections: der/den-er/ihn, die-sie, das-es, die-sie.

11.4 Food-Related Verbs
• essen (I) - to eat, to be eating, to do eat
• trinken - to drink, to be drinking, to do drink
• bekommen - to get/receive, to be getting/receiving, to do get/receive
• möchten (M) - would like
• wollen (M) - to want, to be wanting, to do want
Of these five verbs, only trinken and bekommen are regular. Essen is irregular (that's what
the "I" means). Do you remember from the last lesson 'lesen' and 'sehen'? In both of them,
the first 'e' changed to 'ie' in the du- and er/sie/es-forms. Well essen experiences the same
change, except that it changes to 'i', not 'ie'. Also, it acts the same as 'lesen' in the du-form:
You don't have three s's in a row.

Food-Related Verbs

Lesson 1.03 - Essen
Isst sounds and looks a lot like ist.  The minute difference happens to be in the way you
pronounce the s. When you mean eats it is sometimes an overstressed hissing (i.e. extremely
sharp) sound. In normal life Germans, too, can only tell which verb is meant from knowing
the context.
Just like in last lesson, where you could say, "Ich spiele gerne Fußball.", you can also extend
it to food. "I like to eat cheeseburgers." is translated as "Ich esse gerne Cheeseburger."
Before 199611, the usage of ißt and eßt were common, but the new reform rules specify that
these spellings are now the only correct spellings.
The last two verbs (marked (M)) are modals. They will be discussed in the next section.
Section Problems12 >>
11.5 Modals
In the introduction13, you learned that German has no helping verbs.  Instead, they have
modals, words that basically do the same thing.
Modals are conjugated very differently from normal verbs. The ich- and er/sie/es-forms are
always the same, while the du-form adds an 'st'. Most modals experience a vowel change
from singular to plural, and the rest is the same.
11.5.1 Möchten
'Möchten' isn't technically a modal, but it acts exactly the same. There is no vowel change,
and the ich- and er/sie/es forms are "möchte". Here is the complete conjugation:
11                                                                                                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20spelling%20reform%20of%201996
12                                                                                                http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/%2FProblems%23Food-Related%20Verbs
13                                                                                                Chapter 6 on page 17
52

Person   Singular               Plural
1st      ich         möchte     wir      möchten
2nd      du          möchtest   ihr      möchtet
3rd      er/sie/es   möchte     sie      möchten

Lesson 1.03 - Essen
'Möchten' means "would like" and can be applied to food (e.g. Ich möchte einen Cheese-
burger.).  Möchten can be translated even more literally as "would like to", and is tra-
ditionally used with an infinitive verb at the end of the sentence (e.g.  "Ich möchte jetzt
gehen"/"I would like to go now"). However, this infinitive is not necessary if it's completely
obvious what you're talking about (If you say "Ich möchte einen Cheeseburger", everyone
will assume that you would like a cheeseburger to eat.)
(Note:  Technically, "möchten" is not a word.  The above cited conjugation is actually
the "Konjunktiv" of "mögen", which has become so popular as a phrase, that even many
Germans today aren't aware of it any more, so you don't need to worry about it.  "Etwas
mögen" means "to like to", and "I would like" is the closest translation of "ich möchte.")
11.5.2 Wollen
'Wollen' is a true modal; it even changes vowels. Ich/er/sie/es will and du willst. Here is
the complete conjugation:
54

Person   Singular             Plural
1st      ich         will     wir      wollen
2nd      du          willst   ihr      wollt
3rd      er/sie/es   will     sie      wollen

Lesson 1.03 - Essen
'Wollen' can also be applied to food, but may be considered impolite and demanding ("Ich
will einen Cheeseburger!" roughly means "I demand a cheeseburger!" Möchten should be
used instead: "Ich möchte einen Cheeseburger!" = "I want a cheeseburger!").
'Wollen' should not be confused with the future tense, despite the presence of the English
word 'will' in the conjugations.  However, will14  can also mean an intent or a document
showing what one wants to happen.  So it is not so different from 'to want' as possibly
originally presumed.
11.5.3 Modals with other verbs
This is very important.  When you need to use another verb with a modal (such as
expressing you would like or want to perform an action), the sentence's word order is
somewhat different than it would be in English.  In English, you would state the subject
pronoun (such as "I"), an English equivalent to the modal verb (such as "want"), the action
you want to perform (such as "to eat") and then what the action will be performed on (such
as "hamburger"), making the sentence "I want to eat a hamburger." In German you must
put the action at the end of the sentence, making the sentence "I want a hamburger to eat."
("Ich will einen Hamburger essen.")
Section Problems15 >>
11.6 Hunger and Thirst
In German, instead of saying, "I'm hungry."(Ich bin hungrig), you may also say "I have
hunger."(Ich habe Hunger) The same applies to thirst. Here are the German translations
of the corresponding nouns:
Hunger - der Hunger
Thirst - der Durst
Like in English, these two words do not have a plural form. When using them, you don't
need to worry about the 'der'; you can just say, "Ich habe Hunger" to say "I am hungry"
and "Ich habe keinen Hunger" for "I am not hungry."
Somewhat archaic but still in use are the adjectives hungrig and durstig.  Those are often
used when talking about someone (especially animals):  "Der Löwe ist hungrig" for "The
lion is hungry".

Formal Conversations
11.7 Formal Conversations
In Lesson 117, you learned how to talk formally, using phrases like "Guten Morgen!" and
"Wie heißen Sie?". There are, however, a few words that are 'survival words' in Germany,
specifically:
Danke - Thank you, Thanks
Bitte - Please and You're welcome.
To make this even more formal, you can tack on the word 'schön' to the end of "Thank you"
and "You're welcome" to make 'dankeschön' and 'bitteschön' (both one word) in response.
'Schön' literally means 'pretty' (you'll relearn this next lesson).
Some other ways to say "thank you":
• Dankeschön - Thank you very much
• Danke sehr - Thanks a lot
• Herzlichen Dank ("herzlichen" means sincere or from the heart; you may remember it
from "Herzlichen Glückwunsch zum Geburtstag!" last lesson)
• Vielen Dank - Thanks a lot
• Tausend Dank* - Thanks a million (literally meaning a thousand, but English is more
generous)
• Aufrichtigen Dank* - would be "thank you sincerely" (very formal)
* - You will not be tested on these phrases.
Some other ways to say "You are welcome":
• Bitteschön!
• Bitte sehr!
• Gern geschehen! - Don't mention it
• Gerne! - also meaning "gladly"
• Kein Problem! - No problem
• Dafür nicht!* - (Do) not (thank me) for this (only used in Northern Germany)
* - You will not be tested on this phrase.
These might also be useful:
Entschuldigung - Excuse me, Pardon
Es tut mir leid - Sorry, I'm sorry

11.8 Kein-words
Twice you have been taught that the ending of the indefinite article for plurals would be
eine (for Nominative and Accusative cases), if there was an indefinite article for plurals.

57

Lesson 1.03 - Essen
Now that lesson applies.  The kein-words have the same endings as the ein-words, and
they mean the opposite:  no, not any, none.  For example, "kein Cheeseburger" means
"no cheeseburger". "Keine Cheeseburger" (in this case Cheeseburger is plural) means "No
cheeseburgers".  Notice the 'e' at the end of 'keine'.  That's the ending for plurals and
feminine nouns and can be likened to the "der, die, das -> die" relationship, where the
feminine article serves for the plural as well.
Section Problems19 >>
11.9 Ordering at a Restaurant in Germany
das Restaur'ant' (French pronunciation) - Restaurant
UNKNOWN TEMPLATE Audio
Fr-Restaurant.ogg
There are many restaurants you might find in Germany.  Much like in English-speaking
countries, you would more likely use the name of the restaurant than name what kind of
restaurant. If you want to address the wish to eat a certain food, there are two ways:
example: "wanting to eat chinese food"
1. "Ich möchte gerne zum Chinesen." - literally: "I want to go to the Chinese (restaurant)."
2. "Ich möchte gerne chinesisch essen (gehen)." - literally: "I want to (go) eat Chinese (style
food)."
Here are some more restaurants you can find in Germany:
• American food: "zum Amerikaner" / "amerikanisch essen"*
• Arabic food: "zum Araber" / "arabisch essen"
• Chinese food: "zum Chinesen" / "chinesisch essen"
• French food: "zum Franzosen" / "französisch essen"
• Greek food: "zum Griechen" / "griechisch essen"
• Italian food: "zum Italiener" / "italienisch essen"
• Indian food: "zum Inder" / "indisch essen"
• Japanese food: "zum Japaner" / "japanisch essen"
• Mexican food: "zum Mexikaner" / "mexikanisch essen"
• Spanish food: "zum Spanier" / "spanisch essen"
• Turkish food: "zum Türken" / "türkisch essen"
* "zum Amerikaner" is often used in a jokey way, to express that one is going to either McDonald's
or Burger King. There are few American restaurants, in Germany and they are mostly referred to
as "(American) Diner", so it is not used like "zum Italiener".
19                                                                                                   http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/%2FProblems%23Kein-words

Accusative case prepositions
11.10 Accusative case prepositions
You read at the beginning of this lesson that the Accusative Case covers the direct object
and the objects of some prepositions.  Here are those prepositions that always fall under
Accusative Case
bis - until
durch - through
entlang - along
für - for
gegen - against
ohne - without
um - at, around
You learned um last lesson, and ohne earlier this lesson. Bis, durch, entlang and gegen will
be taught in depth later, and für will be taught now.
Up until this point, you have only worried about the Accusative Case in third person. Für,
meaning 'for', can and should be used in the first and second persons, too.  Here's an
example:
"The cheeseburger is for me." - "Der Cheeseburger ist für mich."
As you can see, 'me' is put into accusative case because the preposition is für.
Section Problems20 >>
11.11 Saying How Food Tastes
In German (as in English) there are several ways of telling how food tastes.  You can do
this with 'gut' and 'schlecht' from Lesson 121 to say:
Der Cheeseburger schmeckt gut - The cheeseburger tastes good
Der Cheeseburger schmeckt schlecht - The cheeseburger tastes bad
But this is bland. Hopefully the food has more flavor than the description of it. You can
use the following words to more colorfully describe how the cheeseburger tastes:
• delicious - lecker
• delicious - delikat* (a lot more formal than lecker)
• tasty - schmackhaft
• juicy - saftig*
20                                                                                             http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/%2FProblems%23Accusative%20case%20preparations

Lesson 1.03 - Essen
• crunchy - knackig (can also mean crispy)
• crispy - knusprig*
• spicy - würzig, pikant
• stale, tasteless - fade* (Austria: fad)
• salty - salzig
• oversalted - versalzen*
• sweet - süß
• bitter - bitter
• sour - sauer
• creamy - cremig*
• hot (in the sense of "very spicy") - scharf - literally meaning "sharp"
• hot (in the sense of "very warm") - heiß
• burnt - angebrannt*
• cold - kalt
• disgusting, terrible - schrecklich
* - You will not be tested on these descriptors.
Schmecken is a regular verb. Here is it's conjugation:
60

Saying How Food Tastes
61

Lesson 1.03 - Essen
The first and second persons really shouldn't be used.  No one is going to say, "You guys
taste salty" or "I taste creamy." So the only forms you really need to know are er/sie/es
schmeckt and sie (plural) schmecken.
You can use 'schmeckt' and 'schmecken' or 'ist' and 'sind' to state how the food tastes. Just
use whichever one you would use in English and it'll usually be correct.
Although the English meaning of schmecken is simply to taste, "Schmeckt der Cheese-
burger?" can be taken in a positive way to mean "Do you like the cheeseburger?". In other
words, schmecken alone can mean to taste good.
Section Problems22 >>
11.12 Dieser-forms
"The cheeseburger tastes good." does not sound that specific as to which cheeseburger you
are talking about. You could be talking about a cheeseburger that is not directly in front
of you. It just isn't clear. Now, if you said, "This cheeseburger tastes good.", it would be
obvious that you're talking about the cheeseburger you're eating.  'Dieser' is the German
translation for 'this': "Dieser Cheeseburger schmeckt gut."
11.12.1 Dieser
'Dieser' is a special adjective. It changes forms in different situations: different genders and
different cases. It can also mean 'these' when modifying a plural. Here are its forms:
                                                                                                   Masculine                                                                 Feminine   Neuter   Plural
Nominative Case                                                                                    dieser                                                                    diese      dieses   diese
Accusative Case                                                                                    diesen                                                                    diese      dieses   diese
As you can see, dieser is only appropriate for modifying masculine nouns in nominative case.
But 'Cheeseburger', which is masculine, is the subject of the sentence, "Dieser Cheeseburger
schmeckt gut." So it is correct in that circumstance.
11.12.2 Jeder
Jeder means 'every'.  It acts exactly like 'dieser' in its endings, so it should be easy to
remember. Here are the different forms:
                                                                                                   Masculine                                                                 Feminine   Neuter

Dieser-forms
Notice the absence of the plural form. When you think about this, it's the same in English:
no one says 'every books'.
11.12.3 Welcher
'Welcher' is the third of this threesome of adjectives. 'Welcher' means 'which' and is used like
the other interrogatives23 (wer, was, wann, wo, warum, wie, and welcher). However, because
the general subject has to be specified, welcher must be inflected before use:  "Welcher
Hamburger ist seine?" Its forms have the same endings as 'dieser'.
                                                                                                   Masculine                                                               Feminine       Neuter    Plural

11.12.4 Connection with Time
You might want to say 'every day', 'this week', 'every morning', or 'which Tuesday night?'.
But to do this, not only do you need to know the jeder-forms, but also the genders of
the times and the cases.  The second one is easy:  Whenever you do something at a
certain time, that time is put into Accusative Case.  Last lesson, you learned the
gender of one time: der Tag. So now you know everything to say 'diesen Tag', 'jeden Tag',
and 'welchen Tag?'                                                                                 (this day, every day, and which day?).  Here are the cases of all the
times in Lesson 224:
Masculine                                                                                          Feminine                                                                Neuter

• Monat                                                                                            • Nacht                                                                 • Wochenende
• Morgen
• Abend
• Nachmittag
When extending to 'which Tuesday night?', remember that the night stays feminine on
Tuesday, so it stays "Welche Dienstagnacht?". Likewise, you can say 'every June' the same
as 'every month': 'jeden Juni'.
11.12.5 This and That

Lesson 1.03 - Essen
Look at the second sentence of each of these German dialogues.  What's missing?  That's
right, instead of "Der Cheeseburger schmeckt sehr gut." and "Die Cheeseburger habe ich
gern.", both of the 'Cheeseburgers, so to speak, are dropped.  We're left with just the
articles, only in this case, they aren't articles. They're demonstrative pronouns.
Demonstrative pronouns aren't scary. They're just the same as the normal pronouns, only
they give more oomph to the sentence.  They can be translated as either 'this' or 'that'
("I'd like a cheeseburger. That tastes very good."), or 'these' or 'those' for plurals ("I eat
cheeseburgers every day. These I like.").
Demonstrative pronouns are exactly the same as the definite articles (well, there is one
change in dative, but that will be covered in Lesson 725). If you are not sure of the gender
(meaning in context, the speaker doesn't know, not that you've forgotten that it's 'der
Cheeseburger'), use 'das', like in "Was ist das?" (What is that?).
11.13 Money and Paying
Germany, Austria, Luxemburg, Belgium and Südtirol - in other words: all German speaking
regions except Switzerland and Liechtenstein- have given up their former currencies and
adopted the Euro as of 1999. One Euro is worth 100 Cents. Because they are not members
of the European Union, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have kept the Swiss Francs (Franken
= 100 Rappen).
'Euro' normally does not change in the plural in German, so you would still say "Ich habe
500 Euro." Nevertheless, there is an exception:  Euro coins.  If you say "Ich habe vier
Euros.", you actually are saying that you have four 1-Euro coins.  Because the backsides
of euro coins look different in each country, many people in Europe have started collecting
foreign euro coins.  In this case you can say "Ich habe irische Euros." (I have Irish euro
coins.) for example.
There is not yet a rule whether or not the word "Cent" has a different plural form.  The
majority of Germans are using the word "Cent" as a plural form, but when they don't it is
simply "Cents".
In German "euro" is pronounced [‘oi-ro], not [you-ro].  For "Cent" there are two pronun-
ciations: you can either pronounce it as in English or you say "tzent". The latter version
seems to be preferred by older people.
When at a restaurant, you will want to pay at the end. You can use this vocabulary to help
you.
• to pay - zahlen
• the bill - die Rechnung*
• the waiter - der Kellner, die Bedienung (alsoder Ober)**
• the waitress - die Kellnerin (but not die Oberin because this means Reverend Mother)

Test
• "How much is that?" - "Was macht das?" ("What does that make?") or the "um-
gangssprachliche" "Wie viel kostet das?"
* To ask for the bill you can say, "Bitte zahlen!", or make it a complete sentence: "Ich würde gern
zahlen!", or "Wir möchten/wollen zahlen!". You can also say, "(Herr Ober), die Rechnung bitte!".
The term "der Ober" is the waiter, but this sounds very old fashioned and is hardly ever used
today. To address the waiter you would probably say "Entschuldigen Sie, ..." ("Pardon, ...") as in
"Entschuldigen Sie, wir würden gern zahlen" (Pardon me, we would like to pay").
** Although it is perfectly OK to say “Bedienung” or “Kellner” when talking about a waiter or a
waitress, you should not address the waiter by saying "Bedienung!" or even “Fräulein!” which is
regarded very impolite since the 1980s.

Lesson 1.04 - Kleidung
14.1 Hello from Berlin!
In every Lesson from 7 - 15 there is going to be a featured German-Speaking city, which
will be the theme of the lesson.  For 7 - 8 it is Berlin.  There will be famous locations in
Berlin, for this lesson it's Kurfürstendamm and KaDeWe, the shopping area of Berlin. Also
in each lesson there will be facts, so if you ever travel to a German-Speaking country, it'll
be like you are a native!
14.1.1 Facts
It's Time to Change Time
Berlin's time is GMT+1. That means that they are 6 hours ahead of E.S.T. If it's 2:00pm
in New York City, it's 8:00pm (or 20:00) locally.  Please note that Germany changes to
and from daylight-saving time a few weeks before the U.S., so time differences still vary in
March and October.
Tip, Tip, and More Tip
In contrast to many other countries where waiters sometime 'live on the tips' in German-
speaking countries service personnel always receive a regular wage (usually per hour) and
the tip is always an extra for good service. Not to give a tip will probably give the waiter
the impression that either service or product were not that good and you are too polite to
admit this, but not tipping is not considered 'rude'. If you tip you usually round up, up to
50 Cents for coffee or up to the next 5 euros for lunch, e.g. 2,70                                € becomes 3,00                                                                   € and 21   €
become 25                                                                                         €.  Also, tipping is only expected when you get served, i.e.  when the service
personnel bring something to your table, so if you pay at a counter - like at McDonald's
or StarBucks - you don't tip at all. Only when having a large party, like celebrating your
birthday in a restaurant, you do extra tipping.  For a night you should pay 30 EUR to
80 EUR per waiter and give it separately to the manager (“für die Bedienung”).  In many
restaurants it is normal the tip is shared with the kitchen personnel.  Paying with credit
card or debit card makes tipping difficult, because there is no line on the bill to fill in the
tip. Always tip when paying, don't leave money on the table.
Shopping Locations
There are two major shopping locations. The Kurfürstendamm in the old west is lined
with boutiques and department stores. It continues eastwards for about three hundred yards
where you can visit KaDeWe, the biggest department store in Europe.  On the newly-
developed Friedrichstraße in the old east, the famous French store Galleries Lafayette
is to be found together with a maze of underground shopping malls.  Shops are generally
open 9am-8pm Monday through Saturday.  In the outskirts most shops close at 4pm on
Saturdays.

if you want.

Bedding
The bedding section is also quite bare, but that is because it will be discussed further in
Lesson 12.

• Passen die Kopfkissenbezüge auf das Kopfkissen?
Does the pillow case fit the pillow?
And with that question there are other variations of it you can ask, like...
• Passt die Decke auf das Bett?
Does the blanket fit the bed?

14.4 Money
Germany, Austria, Luxemburg, Belgium and Südtirol - in other words: all German speaking
regions except Switzerland and Liechtenstein- have given up their former currencies and
adopted the Euro as of 1999.  Because they are not members of the European Union,
Switzerland and Liechtenstein have kept the Swiss Francs. Currently 1 EUR is 1.34 USD.
Now if you were at a shopping center in German like Kurfürstendamm,                       and you were
shopping at a boutique here is some vocabulary you might want to know.
• Was macht das?
Was kostet das?
How much does it cost?
• Das Hemd kostet 120 Euro.
The shirt costs 120 euros.
• Das kostet 690 Euro.
That costs 690 euros (all together).

Note: The word coin (Münze) mostly turns to Stück when a word or number is put together
with it.

Lesson 1.04 - Kleidung
Even though in the vocabulary we list the 1, 2, 5, 10, 100 Euro there are more Euro notes.
The twenty, fifty, two hundred, and five hundred Euro notes are the ones we didn't list, also
there are cent coins.

14.4.1 German Math
In written German, a comma is used (e. g. in prices) where we would put a decimal point in
English. Thus € 5,49 (or 5,49                                                                   €) means five euros and forty-nine cents. When a price ends
in a round number of euros, it is most commonly written as € 5,- etc. The reverse is also
true. Where as English uses a comma to split up large numbers, German uses a dot. So "€
6.945" means sechs tausend neunhundertfünfundvierzig (six thousand nine hundred
and forty-five) euros - not six point nine four five euros.

Lesson 1.04 - Kleidung
I like it!
Er/Sie/Es gefällt mir!
I don't like it!
Er/Sie/Es gefällt mir nicht!
Now if you try something on or you're looking for a soft shirt with a tight fit, you find it,
feel it, try it on, but it's fairly expensive you might say this...
In  English:  The shirt looks great!  The shirt feels soft,  fits tight.  The shirt is very
comfortable. How much does it cost? Oh no! The shirt is expensive! 55 euros is a little too
much for me.
In German: Das Hemd sieht prima aus! Das Hemd fühlt sich weich an, es sitzt eng. Das
Hemd ist sehr bequem. Wieviel kostet es? Oh nein! Das Hemd ist teuer! 55 Euro sind mir
ein bisschen zuviel.
The phrases to describe the shirt were...
The shirt looks great.
Das Hemd siehtprima aus.
The shirt feels soft.
Das Hemd fühltsich weich an.
The shirt fits tight.
Das Hemd sitzteng.
Now, the bold words are verbs that are one part in describing how the shirt is. The other
half of describing it is the adjectives like soft, tight, great, etc. And as you can see the verb
"looks" is separable, but we will get into that later.
14.5.2 Clothing-Related Verbs
And now getting into verbs - here are some of the verbs, and also some of these are Separable-
Prefix Verbs, like aussehen, anprobieren, and anhaben.  But we will study those in more
detail later. Also we will be learning about "tragen".
English                                                                                             German
To look                                                                                             aussehen
He looks                                                                                            Er sieht aus
To try on                                                                                           anprobieren
He tries on                                                                                         Er probiert an
to put on                                                                                           anziehen
He puts on                                                                                          Er zieht an
To take                                                                                             nehmen
To buy                                                                                              kaufen
To have on/wear                                                                                     anhaben, tragen
He has on/wears                                                                                     Er hat an

Separable Prefix Verbs
14.6 Separable Prefix Verbs
Many German verbs change their meaning by adding prefixs, which are often preposition
such as ab-, an-, auf-, aus-, bei-, ein-, mit-, vor-, or zu-.The verbs anhaben (to wear)
and aussehen (to look) are both verbs with separable (trennbar) prefixes. That is, when
used next to the subject pronoun, the prefix is separated from the verb and put at the end
of the sentence or clause. Or, better put, In the present tense and imperative, the prefix is
separated from the infinitive stem.
Examples:
"Ich habe einen Mantel an." ("I'm wearing a coat." Or, more literally translated, "I have a
coat on.")
"Was hast du an?" ("What are you wearing?" or "What do you have on?")
However, when the separable-prefix verb is put at the end of the sentence, such as when
used with a modal verb, the verb in question and its prefix are not separated.
Examples:
"Du willst einen Mantel anhaben." ("You want to wear a coat.")
"Willst du eine Bluse anhaben?" ("Do you want to wear a blouse?")
Section Problems6 >>
14.7 Tragen
Instead of "anhaben" the verb "tragen" is often used. The sentences from above would then
be:
"Ich trage einen Mantel." ("I'm wearing a coat." )
"Was trägst du?" ("What are you wearing?")
"Du willst einen Mantel tragen." ("You want to wear a coat.")
"Willst du eine Bluse tragen?" ("Do you want to wear a blouse?")
The verb "tragen" has two meanings: "to wear" and "to carry".  So if someone says "Ich
trage Schuhe" only the context will tell you whether the person is carrying the shoes in his
hands or actually wearing them. Tragen is a different kind of irregular verb -- one that not
only changes at the end of the word, but also changes internally.  Notice that the vowel
in tragen's second and third-person forms changes from an a into an ä. Other verbs with
similar conjugation patterns include fahren, graben, schaffen, and waschen.

Colors
14.8 Colors
Color are also another great way to describe clothes like Das rote Hemd passt gut.which
means The red shirt fits well.
Read the following paragraph, try to find the words described to have a color.
Wir fahren in den Schwarzwald. Ich habe ein grünes Hemd getragen. Die Reise war lang.
Es begann kälter zu werden und abzukühlen.  Ich hörte Musik auf meinem braunen iPod.
Ich bin schließlich eingeschlafen.  Als ich aufwachte, sah ich den blauen Himmel und den
weißen Schnee.
If you found 5 words you are right.
Schwarz which means black (the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) is a wooded moun-
tain range)
Grünes Hemd which is a green shirt.
Brauner iPod which is a brown iPod.
Blauer Himmel which is blue sky.
And weißer Schnee which is white snow.

Banks and Money
Germany's main banks are Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank. There are
many banks of all kinds throughout the country. Banks are open Mon-Fri 9am-12pm and
2:30-4pm. On Thursdays, they are open until 5:30 or 6pm. Changing money is best done
at a bank because their rates will be better than exchange services located at a Bureau
de Change.  Major post office branches and travel agents also offer currency exchange.
Germany is one of 15 European countries that have replaced their national currencies with
the Euro, which is stronger to the U.S. Dollar, but weaker than the British Pound.

15.3.1 The Family
Home is where the heart is, they say. And what is in the home? Family! of course, so this
is a very important section of the lesson. It'll give all vocabulary for the family, and later
in a different section, you'll learn how to describe your brothers and sisters or any person!
And now to get started lets do some vocabulary...

Now even though many of these are common phrases you and I would say in everyday life,
some of these are rather used when you are on a visit to grandmother's, or things your
mother would say.  Maybe you notice some of these in the dialogue.  Now you might be
asking "How am I going to speak fluent German, if I just learn phrases?" Like I said, these
are basically from the dialogue, and you can study these to look at the word order.  Also
certain things are just different in German, like "Wie heißt du?" which translates literally
to "How are you called?" when we use "What is your name?".  Okay let's get started on
these common phrases...
Du bist ja richtig groß geworden.
You have grown up so much (usual sentence used by Opa und Oma)
Hast du uns etwas mitgebracht?
Have you brought something for us?
Nun sei nicht so aufgeregt.
Now don't be so excited.
Komm rein.
Come in.
(Sie) Wurden schon ausgepackt.
(They) Have already been opened.
(Sich) Bedanken für etwas.
To thank for something.
Using Formal and Informal Pronouns in the Family
Some very conservative families might still use Sie with grandparents or even                    parents!
This is sometimes practiced in families of nobility or exterritorial cultural islands in which
93

Lesson 1.05 - Volk und Familie
older German customs have survived. However, using "Sie" feels very outdated to the vast
majority of people. In practically every family all members use du with each other.
15.3.2 Describing People
I can't describe in words how important this section of the lesson is.  Even though you
have already learned to describe to some degree, here we will introduce a new aspect of
describing, and we will review.  But how could we describe if we didn't have vocabulary?
Here it is...

The verb used most often for describing is "to be" which we learned in the first lesson. Some
examples are: He iswet, This isstupid, I amlazy. But you do use other verbs like feel, look,
etc.  This lesson we will be sticking mostly with the verbs we've learned in the past.  We
will, however, learn one new verb.  All sentences we will create will be in the nominative
case. Okay, let's get started!

People
In term of beauty, you can say four basic things.  These aren't the all but these are the
easiest and simplest ones.
She is beautiful.
Sie ist schön.
He is ugly.
Er ist hässlich.
These two use the verb to be, and the next one will use the verb to look which would need
something else in order to make sense.
She looks beautiful, but that shirt is ugly.
Sie sieht schön aus, aber dieses Hemd ist hässlich.
He looks ugly, but he looked handsome yesterday.
Er sieht hässlich aus, aber gestern sah er schön aus.
And in the last sentence it says "ausgesehen." Don't worry about that--it wouldn't be taught
until Level 3. So since you get the idea of describing, let's learn a new verb! And the new
verb is klingen which is to sound. As in "He sounds weird.", "She sounds boring." Since
we know how to describe, we really don't have to cover it. It's works just like other verbs.
He sounds nice.
Er klingt nett.
They sound funny.
Sie klingen komisch.
Remember that when describing it's S+V+A, or subject, verb, then adjective. Exactly like
in English. For right now, that's all for describing things. We are going to have some small
describing lessons with some parts of this lesson.
15.3.3 Related Verbs
Okay we just went over the verb in the previous section. This will basically be a list that will
help you memorize them better, and there is not a lot. Other than "klingen" and "fühlen"
you should know all of these. The "Er sieht aus" is to show you it is a separable-prefix verb.

15.3.4 Nationality
This is also a large section of this lesson: nationality, and it's very important.  There are
many nationalities, too many to go over in this lesson, but you will learn more nationality
as this level and book goes on. Right now we are just going to have a vague little list, and
as this section goes on there will be more. Finally, gentlemen, get ready to have your minds
blown...

Describing People with Nationality
It is no surprise you can describe people with nationality, most times, it's stereotypical, like
Norwegians are blonde, tall, etc. or Germans wear lederhosen, drink beer, and play polka all
day long, but that is just not true. However you can just use it for what it is, a nationality.
If you do describe people by nationality this will help. Okay, you should already know how
to describe, right?
This part we will get more in to detail later, but right it is an important part of describing
people with nationality, even though in English we most times don't do this, in German
they do.  The difference between nationality and language, like in English, French and
French.  But in German it is französisch and Franzose, Französin.  This also is how
it works for nationality describing by noun or adjective, which we are going to learn right
now.
Noun or Adjective Nationality
There are two ways to describe someone.  With a noun-based nationality word or an
adjective-based nationality word.  But note that in German the noun-based form is used
more often.
Example: Ich bin Schwede (I am Swedish) and Ich bin schwedisch (I am Swedish)
Example: Ich bin Franzose (I am French) and Ich bin französisch (I am French)

15.3.5 Age
Now we are all familiar with the word "alt", which meansold. And in English, to find
out somebody's age we ask "How old are you?".  In German it is exactly the
same. The "alt" kind of belongs to the interrogative adverb, so in both German
and English it may be in front of the verb:
Wie alt bist du?
How old are you?
Now to ask the question with 1st person it is...
Wie alt bin ich?
How old am I?
And as response you might get...
97

Lesson 1.05 - Volk und Familie
Ich bin __ Jahre alt.
I am __ years old.
Du bist __ Jahre alt.
You are __ years old.
And now the plural version of the 1st person...
Wie alt sind wir?
How old are we?
The responses you will get is...
Wir sind __ Jahre alt.
We are __ years old.
Ihr seid __ Jahre alt.
You all are __ years old.
To ask this important question in the                                                            2nd person. First, we will learn the biggest question
here, "How old are you?" which is...
Wie alt bist du?
How old are you?
And there is only one response to this it is...
Ich bin __ Jahre alt.
I am __ years old.
For the equally important plural 2nd person...
Wie alt seid ihr?
How old are you all?
Which the response is...
Wir sind __ Jahre alt.
We are __ years old.
And formal question, for both singular and plural is...
Wie alt sind Sie?
How old are you?
How old are you all?
You should all ready get the pattern for this, but we are going to keep on doing this list, if
you aren't sure of something or you are confused. So for the 3rd person...
Wie alt ist er/sie?
How old is he/she?
98

Possessives
The responses to this are...
Er ist __ Jahre alt.
He is __ years old.
Sie ist __ Jahre alt.
She is __ years old.
And now the plural 3rd person of question and response...
Wie alt sind sie?
How old are they?
And of course the response...
Sie sind __ Jahre alt.
They __ years old.
Now with some people you might be able to guess their age, and you could ask them directly
about it. This is usually pretty of rude, but it illustrates nicely how the phrase has to be
changed if you ask a yes-no-question, so let's get started, anyway!
Bist du __ Jahre alt?
Are you __ years old?
Ist er/sie __ Jahre alt?
Is he/she __ years old?
Sind sie __ Jahre alt?
Are they __ years old?
Note the inversed order between "Wie alt bist du?" und "Bist du __ Jahre alt?" This is
exactly the same as in English!

16 Lesson 1.06 - Schule
Lesson I.9: Schule
16.1 Hello from Berlin!
16.1.1 School in Germany
•                                                                                                School is not regulated nationwide, but by each Land
•                                                                                                German "Kindergarten" is optional - it translates rather to "play school", "Vorschule"
being roughly the equivalent to "Kindergarten"
•                                                                                                From the age of six on, all Germans attend a "Grundschule" (elementary school) for four
or six years, depending on the Land.
•                                                                                                After that, they go to either
• the "Hauptschule" which is industrially oriented,
• the "Realschule", which is skill oriented,
• the "Gymnasium", which is academically oriented,
• or the "Gesamtschule", or comprehensive school.
•                                                                                                Schooling is obligatory until the age of 16, but the Gymnasium diploma "Abitur" can
only be obtained after 12 or 13 years, i.e. at age 18 or 19.
•                                                                                                Latin and sometimes even ancient Greek are regularly taught at the Gymnasium.  For
the "Abitur", at least two foreign languages as well as some calculus and analysis classes
have to be taken.
•                                                                                                School days often are from 8:00-13:00.  In most 'Länder', only the older students have
additional classes between about 14:00-15:30 (i.e. 8AM - 1PM and 2PM - 3:30PM)
•                                                                                                In most schools, Extracurricular Activities are offered, such as Drama Club or School
Choir, but they are less common than in the U.S. Though many students feel some sort
of identification with their school, most are just happy when they can go home.
•                                                                                                Generally speaking, many schools still are more formal than US or Canadian schools.
•                                                                                                The marking system uses
• 1 (very good, 87,5% or 96%),
• 2 (good 75% or 85%), **
• 3 (satisfactory, 62,5% or 65%),
• 4 (sufficient 50% or 45%).
• 5 (faulty) is failed or 25%.
• 6 (not sufficient) is only used when the student literally hands in a blank sheet or failed.
•                                                                                                These marks can be modified with a "+" or a "-" to indicate a tendency, so e.g. 2+ is a
fairly good mark that corresponds to about 80%.

Lesson 1.06 - Schule
16.2 Dialogue
Silke: Jetzt haben wir Mathe.
Torsten: Oh nein, ich habe überhaupt keine Lust dazu.
Silke: Hast du die Aufgaben gemacht?
Torsten: Ja, im Bus.
Silke: Super! Kann ich sie abschreiben?
Lehrer (Betritt den Raum): Guten Morgen!
Klasse: Guten Morgen!
Lehrer: Wer möchte die Aufgaben an der Tafel rechnen?                                           Florian?
Florian geht zur Tafel, schreibt an und liest vor:
"5 plus 8 ist gleich 13"
"8 minus 5 ist gleich 3"
"3 mal 8 ist gleich 24"
"24 geteilt durch 12 ist gleich 2"
Lehrer: Sehr gut, Florian!
Die Glocke läutet. Es ist Fünfminutenpause.
Silke: Schnell, wir müssen zu Musik!
Torsten: Au ja, darauf freue ich mich schon.
Silke: Was machen wir heute?
Torsten: Wir wollen ein Lied von Grönemeyer singen!
Silke: Welches denn?
Torsten: "Alkohol", glaube ich.
Nach dem Musikunterricht:
Silke: Jetzt haben wir nur noch Geschichte...
Torsten: Komm, wir schwänzen und gehen ins Bistro.
Silke: Schon wieder!
16.3 Und Satz für Satz ...
Oh nein, ich habe überhaupt keine Lust dazu.
"Lust (zu etwas) haben" means "feeling like (it)". "Ich habe keine Lust (dazu)" is "I don't
feel like (it)". "Ich habe überhaupt keine Lust" emphasizes it, meaning "I don't feel like it
at all."
Hast du die Aufgaben gemacht?
Have you the tasks done?
"Did you do your homework?"
Ja, im Bus.
Yes, in the bus.
This is a common practice of students everywhere in the world, I guess...
Notice the contraction of "im", which is derived from "in dem", "in the".
104

Und Satz für Satz ...
Super! Kann ich sie noch schnell abschreiben?
Super! Can I just quickly copy them?
"Super", "Cool", "Toll", are common exclamations ...  "Noch schnell" is here meant as
"while there is still time"
Lehrer (Betritt den Raum): Guten Morgen!
Teacher (enters the room): Good Morning!
Klasse: Guten Morgen!
Class: Good Morning!
Wer möchte die Aufgaben an der Tafel rechnen? Florian?
Who would like the tasks on the blackboard calculate?
"Who would like to do these questions on the blackboard?" Note that "Tafel" is related
to "table", meaning a flat surface, and indeed German "Tafel" can also designate a table
prepared for a feast.
Don't let the weird order of the words disturb you, even if the phrase seems totally incom-
prehensible at first. I'll try to construct this bit by bit:
This is the basic question and answer pair:
"Wer rechnet?" - "Ich rechne."
"Who calculates?" - "I calculate."
To ask, if you want to do something, you use a construction similar to English:
"Wer will rechnen" - "Ich will rechnen."
"Who wants to calculate" - "I want to calculate."
Note that the "to" is already included in the German word "rechnen". "Rechnen" is clearly
already an infinitive, and doesn't need a "zu" to prove it. This is one of the main reasons
why complicated conjugations can survive, they contain information that doesn't have to
be expressed otherwise then...
To be a little more polite (or at least seem like it, since our teacher probably wouldn't take
a no for an answer)
"Wer möchte rechnen?" - "Ich möchte rechnen!"
"Who would like to calculate?" - "I would like to calculate"
This is another example for brevity by conjugation.  The word "möchte" contains the
"would", as it is a "Konjunktiv"-form of the word "mögen" which translates to "like".
Don't be discouraged, many Germans don't realize this, and many don't use the Konjunktiv
correctly, if ever. However, "ich möchte"-phrases are extremely popular, so just use them,
even if you didn't understand yet a word of the explanation above ;-)
Let's introduce objects in our phrase:
105

Lesson 1.06 - Schule
"Wer rechnet die Aufgabe?" - "Ich rechne die Aufgabe"
"Who calculates the task?" - "I calculate the task", meaning "Who answers the
question"
This is a direct object, "Aufgabe" is in the accusative case.  Because this is a feminine
noun, this is not so obvious, but the structure is the same as in:
"Wer sieht den Mann?" - "Ich sehe den Mann."
"Who sees the man?" - "I see the man."
Now, we also have an adverbial expression of the place. This is an expression that defines
the verb, thus ad-verbial.
"Wer rechnet an der Tafel?" - "Ich rechne an der Tafel"
"Who calculates on the blackboard?" - "I calculate on the blackboard"
Now let's put all this together:
"Wer rechnet die Aufgabe an der Tafel?" - "Ich rechne die Aufgabe an der
Tafel."
"Who calculates the task on the blackboard?" - "I calculate the task on the
blackboard"
Note that the order expressions is widely interchangeable.  You can emphasize something
by putting it closer to the end of the question.
And now for the whole phrase in all its glory:
"Wer | möchte | die Aufgabe | an der Tafel | rechnen?" - "Ich | möchte | die
Aufgabe | an der Tafel | rechnen."
"Who | would like | the task | on the blackboard | calculate?" - "I | would
like | the task | on the blackboard | calculate."
It wasn't THAT bad, was it?
Florian geht zur Tafel, schreibt an und liest vor:
Florian goes to the blackboard, writes on and reads out:
"Florian goes to the blackboard, writes down and reads out aloud"
"zur" is another contraction, this time of "zu" and "der". Note that after "zu" follows the
dative case, so "der" is not the masculine but the feminine article.
"anschreiben" splits to "schreibt an", and means literally "writing on".  It is often used
when writing legibly on a large, visible surface such as blackboard or a flipchart.
"vorlesen" splits to "liest vor" and translates to "read aloud".
106

Und Satz für Satz ...
"5 plus 8 ist gleich 13"
"8 minus 5 ist gleich 3"
"3 mal 8 ist 24"
"24 geteilt durch 12 gleich 2"
So, as you might have guessed, plus and minus are the same as in English - they are just
pronounced German.  The verbs "addieren" and "subtrahieren" are probably not difficult
either...  "Ist gleich" or short "gleich" or just "ist" corresponds obviously to "is equal to"
or "equals".
"mal" means "times".  This is also used in every day phrases, such as "100mal habe ich
dir gesagt ..." "I told you a 100 times ..." The corresponding verb is "malnehmen" or
"multiplizieren"
"geteilt durch" is literally "divided by", and the verb is "teilen" or "dividieren".
Lehrer: Sehr gut, Florian! Very good, Florian!
Now, that was easy!
Die Glocke läutet. Es ist Fünfminutenpause.
The bell rings. It is five-minute-break
Between single classes, there is usually a break of five minutes to allow teachers and students
to go from one classroom to another.  In most schools, classes such as German, English,
History, Philosophy are taught in the classroom. Classes that use special equipment, such
as all sciences, music and arts and of course computers and sport are being taught in a
specialized lab classes.  Roughly every second break is 15 minutes long, and if there are
lessons in the afternoon, there's often a break of 45 to 60 minutes for lunch.
Schnell, wir müssen zu Musik!
Quick, we must to music!
This sentence sounds strange.  This is, because in everyday German, sometimes the verb
gehen can be left out, if it is clear what is meant. In this case, the complete phrase would
have to be "Wir müssen zu Musik gehen". But since Torsten will not think Silke is going
to fly there, there will be no misunderstanding. Additionally, the word "class", or "course"
is missing, which is the usual way of students to talk about their subjects.
Note: In English, the phrase might be "We have to go to the music room" instead of must.
The German translation "Wir haben in den Musikraum zu gehen" would be understood,
but is quite formal. Additionally, there is a connotation that the speaker distances himself
from the order he is being given.
Au ja, darauf freue ich mich schon!
Oh yes, to this look forward I myself already!
Whew, what was that?
107

Lesson 1.06 - Schule
Let's start at the beginning. "Au ja" ist an exclamation meaning "cool", "that's great". It
has nothing to do with the German equivalent of "ouch!", which is "au(a)!"
"Sich freuen" means "being happy". It is reflexive such as in "I help myself", because the
subject and the object are the same. Some phrases simply are constructed like this, even if
there seems to be no real reason to this, and many languages know this phenomenon. The
"sich" here is technically the accusative of "he, she, it" and is being changed depending on
the person:
ich freue mich                                                                                 I am happy
du freust dich                                                                                 you are happy
er, sie, es freut sich                                                                         he, she, it is happy
wir freuen uns                                                                                 we are happy
ihr freut euch                                                                                 you are happy
Sie/sie freuen sich                                                                            they are happy
Note that "to be happy" actually would be rather translated by "glücklich sein", but it is
the closest English equivalent to "sich freuen".
"Sich über etwas freuen" means "to be happy about something".  This is kind of self-
explanatory.  But "sich auf etwas freuen", literally "to be happy on something" means
"to look forward to". This is a common phrase that uses the on in the same wide sense as
in "on drugs", or "living on something" - there is no spatial relation here...
In "darauf" you recognize the "auf".  The "da" is a demonstrative prounoun such as in
"that place".  "Darauf" actually is another contraction which developped a long time ago
from "da-herauf". The "darauf" is referencing the word "Musik" from Silke's sentence.
So "Au ja, darauf freue ich mich schon" or "to-this look-forward I myself already" just
means "Great, I'm already looking forward to that"
Maybe it comforts you a little that the English phrase in a word-by-word translation to
German would be just as unintelligible...
Was machen wir heute?
What make we today?
"What we (are going to) do today?" Note again, that "machen" often does not translate
to "make", but to "do"!
Wir wollen ein Lied von Grönemeyer singen!
We want a song of Grönemeyer sing!
"We want to sing a song by Grönemeyer!"
Welches denn?
Which then?
"Alkohol", glaube ich...
"Alcohol", believe I...
108

Aufgabe
Note that adding a "glaube ich" is another common phrase, exacly as "I think" or "I believe"
can be added to an English phrase. (Never mind the word order, this is because Alcohol is
the object, so the verb is at the second position in the text)
Herbert Grönemeyer1 is a very popular German rock singer from the Ruhr region. His most
famous songs include "Männer", "Bochum" (a city in the Ruhr region), "Mensch" and also
"Alkohol".
Nach dem Musikunterricht:
After the music class:
"Unterricht" comes from "unterrichten" "to teach", and means simply "class". Better not
think about "under" and "right" here, which you might have correctly recognized as the
word's components "richten" literally means "to correct".
Jetzt haben wir nur noch Geschichte...
Now have we only still history...
"Now we have only history left"
Komm, wir schwänzen und gehen ins Bistro.
Come, we skip and go in the bistro.
"Come on, let's skip class and go to the bistro instead".  As in English, "Komm" can be
used to motivate others.
There is yet another contraction here "ins" is derived from "in das", meaning "in the".
"das" is the neutral article in accusative case here.

Roswitha                                                                                     Den Adventskranz stellen wir wie jedes Jahr auf den Wohnzimmertisch

19.3 Weihnachten in Deutschland
In Germany the advent season begins on Sunday four weeks before Christmas. It's the day
where many families decorate their houses or flats, begin to bake some biscuits and start to
sing some Christmas carols.  One typical decoration is the advent wreath, which has four
candles - one candle is lit in the first week, two candles in the second week, etc.               - and
normally stands on the dining table or on the coffee table. Another tradition, especially for
children, is the advent calendar that you hang on the wall. They've often got 24 doors and
you're only allowed to open one a day.  Other typical Christmas decorations are a crib, a
Räuchermann - a wooden figure that blows flavour of incense cones - in Northern Germany
a Moosmann, Christmas pyramids and Schwibbogen and nutcrackers and poinsettias and
much more. Most Christmas markets start in the first week of Advent. There you can buy
some little Christmas presents, decorations, ride some carnival rides, and often drink some
hot spiced wine - the children drink punch for children, listen to carolers and enjoy a warm,
snowy atmosphere. On the 6th of December, German children celebrate St. Nicholas Day.
The children put a boot in front of the door and wait until St. Nicholas brings little presents
that are often sweets, walnuts, apples, tangerines and oranges.  Bad children get birching
by Knecht Ruprecht (which is now forbidden in Germany). Pupils do a secret Santa with
other pupils on the last school days before the Christmas holidays, which are often two or
three weeks long.  St.  Nicholas looks similar to Santa Claus who brings big presents on
the evening of the 24th of December; in Southern Germany Christkind brings the presents.
Most families decorate their Christmas trees on this day with Christmas baubles and tinsel
and candles and so forth.  After the Christmas dinner, the whole family sits next to the
Christmas tree and exchanges gifts.
Merry Christmas!                                                                                  Frohe Weihnachten!

*Polite form.
The accusative case is that of the object of a verb. Only transitive verbs take direct objects.
The pronoun (and noun in two cases) object in each of these sentences is underlined in
the German and the English:
Können Sie mich verstehen?                                                                        Can you understand me?
Ich kann Sie verstehen.                                                                           I can understand you.
Ich kann sie verstehen                                                                            I can understand (her or them).
Ich kann ihn dir zurück kicken!  I can kick it back to you!
Note the order of the pronouns in this last sentence.  If the direct object (here: ihn) is a
personal pronoun, it precedes the dative (dir); if it were a noun, the dative would precede
it, as in these sentences:
Hier, ich kicke dir den Ball zu.                                                                  Here, I kick the ball to you.
Darf ich Ihnen meine Freundin vorstellen?  May I introduce my friend to you?
Other uses of the accusative case in German will be explored in future lessons.  Tables of
the personal pronouns in all cases are summarized in Pronoun Tables2.

Lesson 3.04 - Die Geschäftsleute
The dative case is that of the indirect object of a verb. The pronoun indirect object of
these sentences is underlined in the German and the English:
Es geht mir gut                                                                                 It goes (for) me well
Wie geht es dir?                                                                                How goes it (for or with) you
Und können Sie mir sagen...?    And can you tell me...?
Karl gibt ihm den Ball                                                                          Karl gave him the ball.
Wie geht es Ihnen?                                                                              How goes it (with) you? (How are you?)
This last sentence is an example from Gespräch 1-2 using the polite form of 'you'. Whether
singular or plural must be established by context. This next sentence translates with ihnen
as 'them':
Wie geht es ihnen?                                                                              How goes it with them? (How are they?)
The meaning of ihnen (or Ihnen) would have to come from context in a conversation.
Another use of the dative case in German is after these prepositions:  aus,  bei,  mit,
nach, seit, von, zu.  You will be introduced to the meanings of these prepositions over
many future lessons rather than all at once, because some have many meanings in English.
Indeed, because each language associates specific prepositions with many common sayings
(and these often do not correspond in German and English), these "little" words can be
troublesome for students.  Nonetheless, you should memorize now the list of prepositions
above to always remember their association with the dative case.  Tables of the pronouns
in all cases are summarized in Appendix 23.
Word order in a German sentence with an indirect object depends upon whether that

Republik Österreich Wenn er auf den Kontinent fährt, wandert Herr Standish gern.  Heute
früh fährt er in die Stadt St. Pölten in Niederösterreich. Er spricht mit einer fremden Frau:

gibt dort das beste Frühstück. Das Restaurant ist links neben dem Hotel, um die Ecke.

ist?

Figure 10
Karte: St. Pölten in Österreich
Niederösterreich ist sowohl flächenmäßig als auch nach Einwohnern das größte der neun
österreichischen Bundesländer. Sankt Pölten ist die Landeshauptstadt von Niederösterreich.
Der Name St. Pölten geht auf den heiligen Hippolytos zurück, nach dem die Stadt benannt
wurde.
Die Altstadt befindet sich dort, wo vom 2. bis zum 4. Jahrhundert die Römerstadt Aelium
Cetium stand. 799 wurde der Ort als "Treisma" erwähnt. Das Marktrecht erhielt St. Pöl-
ten um 1050, zur Stadt erhoben wurde es 1159.  Bis 1494 stand St.  Pölten im Besitz des
Bistums Passau, dann wurde es landesfürstliches Eigentum.  Bereits 771 findet sich ein
Benediktinerkloster, ab 1081 gab es Augustiner-Chorherren, 1784 wurde deren Kollegiatss-
tift aufgehoben, das Gebäude dient seit 1785 als Bischofssitz.  Zur Landeshauptstadt von
Niederösterreich wurde St. Pölten mit Landtagsbeschluss vom 10. Juli 1986, seit 1997 ist
es Sitz der Niederösterreichischen Landesregierung.

70 Adjectives and Adverbs
70.1 Adjectives
Adjectives are words that describe nouns. Most adjectives are stand-alone words; however,
present and past participles can also be used as adjectives.  Numbers are also adjectives,
though they do not decline.
Adjectives may be either predicate or attributive.  Predicate adjectives are adjectives con-
nected to a noun through a verb known as a copula. Those verbs in German are sein (to be),
werden (to become), and bleiben (to remain). Other verbs, such as machen and lassen im-
part a predicate adjective onto an accusative object. Predicate adjectives are never inflected.
Ich bin noch ledig.                                                                               (I am still single.)
Trotz des Streites bleiben wir verheiratet.                                                       (Despite the argument we remain married.)
Ich werde böse.                                                                                   (I am getting angry.)
Die alte Milch wird dich krank machen.                                                            (The old milk will make you sick.)
Attributive adjectives precede the noun that they are describing, and are always declined.
Learning the adjective endings is a central part to the study of German.  The adjective
endings are frequently one of the hardest topics for new students to learn.  It is best to
commit the declension tables to memory, while attempting to speak independently. Proper
use of adjective endings, especially in speaking, will come with repeated use.  They are
described in the next part of this chapter.
70.2 Adjective Endings
70.2.1 Forms
This section will make use of the mnemonic Oklahoma, which denotes the fields of nomina-
tive masculine; nominative neuter; accusative neuter; nominative feminine; and accusative
feminine, which resemble the state of Oklahoma in the tables used below. The concept is
used to describe endings in two declension tables: the weak adjective declension, and the
indefinite-article/ein-word declension.
The endings of attributive adjectives can be divided into two groups: strong endings and
weak endings.
Strong Adjective Declension

The strong adjective endings are nearly the same as the der-word endings, with the excep-
tions of masculine and neuter adjectives in the genitive case (marked in bold).

Make note of the region, Oklahoma, in the nominative and accusitive cases, for weak
endings.
The use of a weak or a strong adjective ending depends on what precedes it:

Definite Article, der-words                                                                     Weak Ending
Indefinite Article, ein-words                                                                   Within Oklahoma, Strong Ending
Outside Oklahoma, Weak Ending
No article                                                                                      Strong Ending
The principle guiding adjective endings is that a noun, when possible, should have a primary
case ending. Definite articles and der-words always provide a primary case ending. Indefinite
236

Adjective Endings
articles and ein-words provide primary case endings outside of Oklahoma. Sometimes nouns
have no article, in which case adjectives provide the primary case ending.
70.2.2 Forms in Context of Articles
This terminology - strong and weak endings - is confusing for many students. As the student
develops, he or she will develop an ear for case endings, and will recognize when a noun has
and has not received a case ending. Nonetheless, it is worth providing the three declension
tables that result from this principle.

Adjectives following a definite article or der-word always have a weak ending.  Within
Oklahoma, that is "-e", and outside of Oklahoma, that is "-en". Also dies.., jed.., manch..,
welch.., solch.. and all.. get the same ending as in the table above.

Note how, within Oklahoma, adjectives take strong endings, and outside Oklahoma, they
take weak endings. This is because indefinite articles provide primary endings only outside
of Oklahoma. Also mein.., dein.., sein.., ihr.., unser.., euer.. and Ihr.. get the same ending
as in the table above.

Forms of nouns without articles are rare compared to those with definite and indefinite
articles; however, one must still know the strong declension. Note that the strong adjective
237

Adjectives and Adverbs
declension is almost the same as the der-word endings, with the exceptions of masculine
and neuter in the genitive case (in bold).
70.3 Adverbs
Adverbs based on adjectives are one of the simplest parts of German grammar.  Any
adjective can be used as an adverb simply by placing its uninflected form within the
sentence, usually towards the end.
Das Ehepaar ging gestern fröhlich spazieren.
(The married couple went for a walk joyfully yesterday.)
Other adverbs have no adjectival equivalent. Many of these express time.
Damals (at that time)
Ich bin gestern dort gewesen.                                                                (I was there yesterday.)
Morgens bin ich normalerweise im Büro.                                                       (I am normally in the office in the morning.)
Adverbs can also be based on participles (past and present). These are less common.
Er betrachtete mich bedrohlich.                                                              (He looked at me threateningly.)
Some adverbs are formed by adding -weise to adjectives and nouns in the plural form, and
mean "regarding", "with respect to", or "-wise" in English.  Construction of new adverbs
of this sort is usually frowned upon.
70.3.1 Adverbs based on prepositions
Much of the material in this section will be explained in greater detail in the chapter on
prepositions.
German has a complex system of adverbs based on prepositions, which are used to indicate
direction of motion, location, time, and other concepts.  English also possesses such a
system, though it is used less. Consider the following sentences in English:
1) Could you take the garbage out?
2) Come over this evening if you get the chance.
3) You should just give up.
4) I will look you up in the phone book.
5) The contract, and the conditions contained therein, is hereby declared null and
void. (Legalese)
In both English and German, prepositions and particles derived from prepositions are
treated as adverbs.  In many cases, these prepositional adverbs are associated with spe-
cific verbs.
238

Adverbs
In the first two examples, the italicized prepositions are used as adverbs of motion; in the
first example, the word "out" indicates the direction "out of the apartment"; in the second
case, "over" not only means means the direction "towards", but also implies visitation of a
residence.
The third and fourth examples correspond to separable-prefix verbs in German. The word
"up" is integral to the verb, which would have a different meaning without the adverb.
"To give up", whose infinitive in German would be "to up-give", means "to quit", in sharp
contrast to "to give".  In the fourth example, it is not even possible to "look someone",
whereas it is possible to "look someone up," or "look a candidate's resume over". (English
even has inseparable prepositional prefix verbs; compare "to look s.o. over" to "to overlook
s.o." Many of these verbs have been replaced by verbs based on Latin and Greek.)
The adverbs in the fifth example correspond to da-, wo-, hin- and her- compounds in
German. Such compounds are often used in legal texts in English. In such compounds, the
object of the preposition is replaced with the words "there" or "here", compounded with
the preposition. "Therein" simply means "in it".
The German system of adverbs based on prepositions is considerably more rigorous, and
forms the basis of a large part of the language's morphology.  "To catch on" means "to
begin" in English; In German, the primary word for "to begin" is literally "to catch on"
(anfangen), from which the equivalent noun, der Anfang (the beginning) is derived.  A
remnant of this in English can be found when describe a child's upbringing.
As in English, prepositional adverbs in German to varying degrees alter the meaning of
their associated verb.
Separable-prefix verbs.  This topic is better explored in the chapter on verbs.  Separable
prefixes are themselves adverbs. As in English, many of them are integral to the meaning
of the verb. Fangen means "to catch," whereas anfangen means "to begin".
Most prepositional adverbs are treated as part of the root word in the infinitive, and are
used as such in the construction of participles.  However, not all possible separable-prefix
verbs are lexical; "vorbeikommen" (to come over), "vorbeibringen" (to bring over), and so
on, may not all be listed in a dictionary. It is better to learn "vorbei" as an adverb implying
visitation.
The German prefix in is of note.  It has two adverbial forms.  As in it describes location;
when describing movement, it becomes ein.  Thus, for example, darin means "in there",
whereas darein means "in(to) there". Another example is the word, einleiten, to introduce.
Hin- and her-.   Prepositional adverbs of motion are usually based on hin-,  implying
motion or direction away from the speaker, and her-, implying motion or direction towards
the speaker.  Hin and her are themselves stand-alone adverbs meaning the same thing,
and describe less-specific motion or direction.                                                   (One example in which hin is an integral
separable prefix is the verb hinrichten, which means "to execute.)  Not all verbs formed
from hin- and her- compounds are lexical. Some examples of hin- and her- compounds are:
herab (down, down from)
hinein (in, inside)
hinaus (out, out of, onto)
239

Adjectives and Adverbs
darüber hinaus (furthermore, above all)
dahin (in the direction/towards of known location)
Mastery of hin- and her- requires considerable effort from the student.
Da- compounds are also adverbs, corresponding to "there-" compounds in English.  They
replace specific prepositional objects.  Although are used principally in legal texts and
therefore sound formal in English, they are often employed in written and spoken German
and are convenient replacements for long and complicated prepositional phrases.  Their
comprehension and active use are essential in German.  Da- compounds are formed by
adding da- before the preposition, with an "r" inserted before prepositions starting with a
vowel. There are exceptions to this, and da- compounds are given a fuller treatment in the
chapter on prepositions.
Hier- and dort- compounds also exist in German, though they are used less frequently. As
in English, they are considered formal, and are used primarily in academic and legal texts.
They are best memorized as vocabulary.
hierhin und dorthin - hither and thither

72 Nouns
72.1 What Is a Noun?
A word that can be used to refer to a person, place, thing, quality, or idea; part of speech.
It can serve as the subject or object of a verb. For example a table or a computer. Nouns
start with a capital letter in written language.
72.2 Plurals
German, unlike English, has more than one way to make nouns plural, and plural form, like
gender, must be memorized with every noun.
There are twelve different ways to form plurals in German.  They are formed by affixes
at the end of the word, and the umlaut of the vowel of the stem.  They are - (changing
nothing); -¨; -e; -¨e; -n; -¨n; -en; -¨en; -er; -¨er; -nen (to feminine suffix -in); -s (mainly with
English loan-words); adding "foreign" endings (mainly Latin words); and changing suffixes
(mainly Latin words).
When German nouns are used in the plural, their gender becomes irrelevant.  The plural
can almost be thought of as a gender on its own. In the plural, the definite article is always
"die" when using the nominative and accusative cases.
When using the dative case, "den" is the definite article of all plurals. All plurals not ending
in -n or -s affix an -n.
The definite article of the plural in the genitive case is "der".
Examples
Nominative: Die alten Männerspielen Schach. The old men are playing chess.
Accusative: Ich sah die alten Männerbeim Schachspielen. I saw the old men as they
played chess.
Dative: Ich spielte mit den alten MännernSchach. I played chess with the old men.
Genitive:  Das Schachspiel der alten Männerwar nicht sehr spannend.  The old
men's chess game was not very exciting.
72.2.1 Suffixes
Although gender and plural form are often arbitrary, there exist certain suffixes whose
gender and plural form are regular. They are mainly feminine.
243

Nouns
-ung, -heit, -keit, -schaft, -ion, and -tät
These are all feminine endings, which are pluralized by -en.
• Diskussion(en)
Discussion(s)
• Universtät(en)
University(ies)
-unft
This endings is feminine and is pluralized by changing the stem vowel and adding -e
• Unterkunft
Lodging
• Unterkünfte
Lodgings
-ik
This ending often doesn't have a plural. When it does however, you add -en
• Technik(en)
Technique(s)
Other
When verb infinitives transform into nouns, they do not have a plural form.
• das Sprechen
Language
Many masculine nouns are formed by verbal stems without a suffix. Many of these receive
an umlaut in their plural form.
72.3 Gender
German, like many other languages, gives each noun a gender: Masculine, Feminine, and
Neuter.  Plural nouns also act differently not only with the verb of the sentence, but the
article preceding it.
The way any particular word is classified may not be logical.
Examples:
das Mädchen                                                                                  the girl (neuter)
die Person                                                                                   the person (feminine - even when talking about a man)
244

Gender
However, not all German Nouns are randomly allocated a gender. The following notes will
apply to most nouns but not all.
A note on Mädchen:
This is derived from the diminutive form of Maid (old, rarely used) - Maidchen. Grammat-
ically it is neuter, but when referenced, nowadays the logical feminine gender takes over:
Das Mädchen und ihr Hund. (Das Mädchen und sein Hund would be used in German slang
but is rare and shouldn't be used.)
72.3.1 Masculine
There are far more masculine nouns than of either of the other genders.  The masculine
nominative definite article is der.
72.3.2 Semantic Groups Which Are Masculine

* With, of course, the exception of die Person which remains feminine even when talking
about a man.

72.3.5 Tips For Learning
As most German articles can not be attributed to certain rule, it is best to always learn
the article when learning the noun. You may think of the article as necessary information
belonging to every noun. You avoid a lot of looking-up-time that way.
72.3.6 Looking Up Gender in Dictionaries
Most dictionaries do not give the article.  Instead, you find different sets of abbreviations
which tell you to which class the noun in question belongs.
The most common sets of abbreviations are:
r, e, and s.
r: der, masculine;
e: die, feminine;
s: das, neuter.
The abbreviations of this type are usually given before the noun.
m, f, and n.
m: masculine;
f: feminine;
n: neuter.
The abbreviations of this type are usually given after the noun.
m, w, and s.
m: männlich, masculine;
w: weiblich, feminine;
s: sächlich, neuter.
The abbreviations of this type are usually given after the noun.

Note:  The possessive is not a case of the personal pronoun, rather it's a pronoun itself.
This table shows the possessive pronoun's stem, which is declined as an ein-word (like the
indefinite article).
The genitive case indicates possession or association, and is equivalent to, and replaces, the
English word "of". "Des" and "der" (do not confuse with masculine singular nominative)
mean "of the"; "eines" and "einer" mean "of a/an"; and, "der Sohn guten Weins" means
"the son of good wine" (no article, M, Gen strong adj). Strict replacement of the genitive
case with the word "of" maintains the word-order of the German nominal phrase: possessed
- possessor (in genitive). The genitive case also replaces "'s" in English, though reversing
the word-order (in English: possessor's possessed). German itself also uses an "s" (though
without the apostrophe) to indicate possession, in the same word order as English.  It is
used mainly with proper nouns, such as "Goethes Heimat", as well as for compounding
words.
Standard genitive constructions are used with nouns and modifiers of nouns such as articles
and adjectives, and the inflection they receive implies possession. The first noun may be in
any case and may occur in any part of the sentence; the second noun, which possesses the
first noun, immediately follows the first noun, and is in the genitive case. The noun in the
genitive case need not have any modifiers - e.g., Heimat Goethes, Heimat Katerina, which
mean the homeland of Goethe and Katerina, respectively - though such constructions can
be cumbersome and ambiguous.
Proper treatment of the genitive case, including all of the declensions, is found in another
part of this book.
German pronouns have genitive forms, but they are used only rarely nowadays, mostly in
archaic or formal German. In many cases, a preposition can be added to allow a different
case to be used.
Ich erinnere mich ihrer. (I remember her)
Also possible: Ich erinnere mich an sie.
Wir gedachten seiner. (We thought of him)
Also possible: Wir dachten an ihn.
Herr, erbarme dich unser! (Lord, have mercy upon us)
Also possible: Herr, erbarme dich über uns.
The possessive pronouns (mein-, dein-, unser-, etc.)  are almost identical in form to the
genitive pronouns and but they directly modify their attribute and could be conceived of
as adjectives, though they decline differently.  Alternatively, one could think of possessive
pronouns, e.g., "mein-", as replacing the phrase, "of me".  Directly translated, "mein-"
means "my" in English.
Examples:
265

Pronouns
I want the teacher's book. Let's rewrite this as: I want the book of the
teacher.
-Ich will das Buch des Lehrers (der Lehrerin).
--The genitive case here is masculine (feminine) singular, inflecting the definite article
(des/der) as well as the noun (Lehrer (+s), but not Lehrerin, which doesn't change because
it is feminine).
Without his friend's car, we cannot go home.
-Ohne den Wagen seines Freundes können wir nicht nach Hause fahren.
--Here, two possessive relationships are mentioned.  The car belongs to the friend, and
the friend belongs to "him".  For illustrative purposes, one could conceivably re-write the
prepositional phrase as "without the car (accusitive case) of the friend of him". German's
rendering is far less awkward.
The wall of the building is old and brown.
-Die Wand des Gebäudes ist alt und braun.
--As in the first example, the genitive case here is in the masculine singular, and inflects
the definite article and the noun (M,N add +s/+es in the genitive case).
266

79 Comparison of Pronouns to other
Parts of Speech
Despite the difficulty many people have in learning German declensions, case-endings in
German correspond to each other to a considerable degree. Specifically, the pronouns bear
an obvious resemblance to their parent direct articles.  Learning the corresponding 3rd-
person declensions side-by-side allows some people to comprehend the declension pattern
more easily.
As discussed above, possessive pronouns replace the genitive case for pronouns.  In this
table, they will be placed where the genitive case is, so that their similiarities to other parts
of speech that actually are in the genitive case can become clear.
German is very rigorous in its use of gender, and will use the pronoun corresponding to the
gender of the referential noun, regardless of whether the noun being referenced is a person
(unlike English, which uses "it" for everything not a person or other entities (animals, ships)
in certain contexts).  Der Liberalismus will be referred to as "er", or "he", whereas "das
Mädchen" would be "es", or "it". Many English speakers have trouble with this, especially
in spoken language. Mastery is nonetheless possible with a proper understanding of German
declension and a considerable amount of practice.

N.B.(1) The use of "wessen" is considered old-fashioned, though most Germans would find
it endearing to hear a non-native speaker use the word.  One is encouraged to use the
"gehören + dativ (wem?)" construction, which means "to belong to s.o. (whom?)".
N.B.(2) The dative plural. Except for words whose plural form adds an "-s" (mainly loan-
words), and words whose plural form already ends in "-n"/"-en", all nouns add an "-n/-en"
in the dative plural. Like the s's added to masculine and neuter nouns in the genitive, this
is a remnant from when German inflected all of its nouns, which other languages based
on declension, such as Russian and Latin, retain. Sometimes one will notice an "-e" after
masculine and neuter nouns in the dative case, such as the dedication on the Reichstag
building - "Dem deutschen Volke", "for the German People".
This nominal declension is reflected in the dative plural pronoun (to/for them), "ihnen",
instead of "ihn" (masculine, accusitive). For example,
Helga: Können Sie bitte meinen Brüdern helfen?
Olga: Natürlich, aber ich kann ihnen leider nur nach zwei Tagen helfen.
Helga: Unsere Leben gehen trotzdem weiter.
Make a point of studying and getting used to the dative plural.

80 Sentences
80.1 Sentence Structure in Main clauses
Here is the ultimate syntax guide for a main clause. German allows a considerable amount
of syntactical freedom as parts of speech are indicated through case, rather than syntax.
Nonetheless, there are conventions to follow, especially ones that reduce the ambiguity of
pronouns.
Word-Order in the Main Clause
First Position                                                                               Anything                             Used for emphasis. Sometimes people
will even put a past participle or some
other verb in the first position. You
shouldn't do that until you know what
you are doing. The first position is of-
ten used for the subject (Nominative),
however.
Second Position                                                                              Conjugated Verb                      "habe", "muss", "arbeitete"

Translating a hypothetical English
sentence with three verbs into German,
the first English verb - the conjugated
verb - would be in the second posi-
tion in the German sentence. The
second verb will be on the outside of
the verb-phrase, at the end of the Ger-
man sentence. The third verb will be
immediately before that. Subj . 1 .

verb. This happens to both native-
speakers and those learning the lan-
guage. However, try to avoid it.
This is the officially-sanctioned syntax of a main clause.  However, German syntax is not
written in stone.  One has considerable latitude in the way one constructs one's sentence.
Before fleshing out the topic, here are some rules, conventions, and words of advice:
1) In terms of being placed in proper syntax, the pronouns are the most important, for they
are the ones most liable to ambiguity ("sie" = which person, what part of speech, which
case? Put it in its correct position).
2) It is not possible for a sentence to include all of the listed items, but it is still good to
be able to reproduce that schema from memory.
3) You must be able to recognize an element of a sentence. For example, you must not split
something like, "mit einem Buch", for that is a prepositional phrase, i.e., one and only one
sentence element.  Many other sentence elements are, however, only one word.  You get a
lot better at this as time goes on.
4) Two good mnemonics.  Number one:  pronouns before nouns.  always.  even if it feels
weird to put both your accusative and dative objects before your subject (a noun), you
must get used to it. It doesn't happen very often, though.
5) The second one is "ADDA" (i.e., NOT DAAD, the Deutsche Akademische Austausch
Dienst). ADDA describes, first, the pronouns (Accusative, then Dative), and then the nouns
(Dative, then Accusative). ADDA. think ABBA, but with D's instead of B's.
6) The first position is usually your subject, but can also draw attention to something you
want to discuss.
7) As will be explained below, prepositional phrases and adverbs follow the "Time, Manner,
Place" format.
8) Beyond reducing/eliminating ambiguity, you actually do have a fair amount of freedom.
"Time, Manner, Place" is more a suggestion than a commandment, and most German
textbooks tell you to learn the schema laid out above, but then to speak and write your
sentences with items in ascending order of importance. Put the important stuff at the end.
Then you get to your verb, which gives all of the words in the sentence meaning, resulting
in a crescendo of emotion and understanding. Or not. But you see how that might work.
9) If you speak enough, your verbs start going to the right places.  It will seem perfectly
natural that the verb is in the second position, and that the other verbs are at the end.
Getting used to subordinate clauses takes more time, but eventually your words go to the
right place. Don't worry about making mistakes, but also try not to forget which verb you
have waiting in your head until the sentence ends.

Position of the Verb
10) Banish the terms, "subject", "direct object", and "indirect object" from your head. Get
used to explaining things in terms of "nominative", "accusative", "dative", and "genitive".
Same goes for "linking-" and "helping-verbs". Start talking about modal verbs, and modal-
like verbs.
In general, you have to learn how to talk about grammar to be able to study German
successfully.
11) If you can do the declensions in your head, you can do the syntax in your head. Syntax
is easier.
80.2 Position of the Verb
80.2.1 Clauses with one verb part - Sätze mit nur einem Verbteil
In a main clause (Hauptsatz), the conjugated verb is in second position.

1.                                                                                            Er               geht     nach Hause
2.                                                                                            Heute Abend      fahre    ich mit dem Auto nach

3.                                                                                            Im Park          machte   er einen langen Spaziergang
Second position does not equal second word, as you can see above. However, there is only
one group of words allowed before the conjugated verb.  Such groups of words are called
"phrases". While you can put very long phrases in front of the conjugated verb you mustn't
use two. Therefore the sentence "Heute Abend ich fahre mit dem Auto nach Köln" is wrong.
This is a big difference between English and German syntax.

Position of the Verb
Sometimes you have to use more than one verb part in a clause.  This is true for Perfekt
forms, separable verbs, modals etc. Only one of these verbs is conjugated. The conjugated
verb stays in second position, the other part goes to the end.

Order of phrases - Reihenfolge der Satzglieder
Sometimes there are even three verbs in a sentence.  These usually involve modals and
perfect tenses. The conjugated verb is in the second position. The remaining two verbs are
at the end of the clause, building inwards that is to mean, what would be the second verb in
English is placed at the end, and what would be the third verb is placed before the second
verb.
80.3 Order of phrases - Reihenfolge der Satzglieder
In English, you need the position of phrases to determine whether a noun phrase is a subject
or an object. In German the cases tell you which role is assigned to a certain noun phrase.
Therefore, the word order is less strict.
80.3.1 First Position - erste Position
In neutral sentences the subject is most likely in the first position (Examples 1, 4, 5, 6).
However, you can put everything there you want to stress.  This is very common with
phrases about time or place (Examples 2, 3, 7).  English speakers need to remember that
the first position is restricted to exactly one phrase.
You can even put objects in first position (Example 8).  You do it mostly, if you want to
emphasize the object or if you have to repeat the sentence because your partner has not
understood this particular part of it.
If the subject is not in first position, it goes directly after the conjugated verb (Examples
2, 3, 7, 8), unless preceded by a reflexive pronoun or an accusative or dative pronoun.
80.3.2 Order of Phrases in the Middle of the clause - Reihenfolge der
Satzglieder im Mittelfeld
Introduction
In the middle of the sentence - the part between the two parts of the verb - word order is
quite flexible.
Often the word order for a neutral sentence can be described like this:
1. Time
2. Objects
3. Manner
4. Place
The mnemonic is "STOMP" where S is for subject. However, when looking at wild German
sentences you will find structures that do not follow these principles but are nonetheless
correct.  This is very frequent in spoken language.  Mostly the deviation from the neutral
structure is caused by a special focus. While they are not wrong, it would be inappropriate
to use them all the time. Therefore it is best to learn the principles described here. If you
277

Sentences
have mastered them and can use them without thinking about it, you can try some of the
deviations.
Time
Time seems to be a very important concept for German speaking people.  It is mostly
mentioned very early in the sentence, either at the very beginning in the first position
which means that the subject goes directly after the conjugated verb (i.e.: Gestern war ich
im Kino) or early in the middle field (i.e.:  Ich war gestern im Kino).  The sentence "Ich
war im Kino gestern" is not exactly wrong, but it would sound weird in most situations. It
could be used though in a casual conversation when putting special emphasis on "im Kino",
but it's not the regular sentence pattern.
Order of Objects
The order of objects is different for nouns and pronouns.  Pronouns always come be-
fore nouns, and reflexive pronouns come before everything except nominative pronouns.
ADDA, mentioned above, is a good way to remember the prescribed order of cases for
pronouns and then nouns.  As sentences can contain only two objects, here are the three
possible combinations deriving from ADDA:
Two pronouns: accusative before dative (AD)
I                                                                                             II         Acc. Dat.
                                                                                              Ich habe   sie  ihm  gegeben.
                                                                                              Ich gab    sie  ihm
One noun, one pronoun: The pronoun goes first, regardless of the case
I                                                                                             II         Pronoun  Noun
                                                                                              Ich habe   ihm                  die Kleider gegeben.
                                                                                              Ich gab    sie                  dem Jungen
Two nouns: dative before accusative (DA)
I                                                                                             II         Dat.                 Acc.
                                                                                              Ich habe   dem Jungen           die Kleider gegeben.
                                                                                              Ich gab    dem Jungen           die Kleider

This includes adverbs and prepositional phrases describing how, why, and by what methods

80.3.3 Satzglieder im Nachfeld
In German grammar the term Nachfeld is used to describe parts of the sentence that come
after the second part of the verb. The Nachfeld is neglected in most learner's grammars.
It is mostly used in spoken language, when people add something to a sentence as an af-
terthought or with special emphasis. In written language it is important for comparisons.
You put them almost exclusively in the nachfeld.
Consider the example Peter verdient mehr Geld als Paul(Peter earns more money than
Paul). Now try to convert the sentence to the perfect. If you follow the normal
sentence structure rules you would have to write:Peter hat mehr Geld als Paul
verdient, but this is almost never done. The sentence best accepted by a majority
of German speakers is:Peter hat mehr Geld verdient als Paul. The comparison
is putafterthe past participle.
Note that the two items being compared must be in the same case. Du verdienst mehr Geld
als ich.  This is also correct grammar in English, though it is now almost obsolete among
native English speakers.
80.4 Syntax of Interrogatives and Imperatives
I am putting this up here for the sake of completion.
80.4.1 Interrogatives
Interrogatives (questions) change word order in the first two fields or so. There are two
kinds.  In a question based on a verb, the conjugated verb comes first.  Following that is
the same string of pronouns first and nouns thereafter (and other sentence elements and
finally the remaining verbs) that was detailed above. The main difference between questions
and statements is that the freedom of the first position is eliminated; the item you wanted
to emphasize must now find a different position in the sentence.  The ascending-order-of-
importance convention still holds.
Example:
Q: Hast du schon "Fargo" gesehen?
A: "Fargo" habe ich noch nicht gesehen.
The second kind of question involves a question word or wo-compound, which always comes
at the beginning, and is immediately followed by the conjugated verb.  They are then
followed by the remaining parts of the sentence in the order outlined above. Be mindful of
the case of the question word, and make sure never to use a wo-compound when referring
279

Sentences
to a person.
Q: Warum hast du "Fargo" nie gesehen? (Why have you never seen "Fargo"?)
A: Ich hatte keine Lust. (I had no interest.)
Q: Wem hast du geholfen? (Wem = "whom?" in the dative case.) (Whom have you
helped?)
A: Ich habe meiner Mutter geholfen. (I have helped my mother.)
Q: Bei wem hast du dich beworben?                                                               (From whom have you applied [for a job]?)
A: Beim Geschäft meines Onkels habe ich mich beworben. (I applied at my uncle's
business.)
Q: Worum hast du dich beworben? (For what did you apply?)
A: Um eine Stelle habe ich mich beworben!  Bist du verrückt? (I applied for a
job!
Are you insane?)
And so on.
80.4.2 Imperatives
Imperatives  (commands)  also  slightly  alter  the  aforementioned  main-clause                sentence
structure. Imperatives are formed in several ways:
Geh', bitte!                                                                                    (Please go, informal)
Gehen Sie, bitte! (Please go, formal)
Gehen wir, bitte! (Let's go! Within a group)
This sequence - verb in imperative form, perhaps followed by the person to whom it is
directed in the nominative case (depending on the kind of imperative used, however) - is
then followed by all of the other elements of the sentence, in the aforementioned order.
German-speakers, like English-speakers and the speakers of many other languages, consider
the use of the imperative mood to be rude, and, as in English, use a conditional or subjunc-
tive construction to convey requests.  This will be dealt with in a different section of this
book.
Both of these syntaxes are very easy to master once you understand main-clause syntax.
80.5 Coordinating Conjunctions
Before moving on to subordinate and relative clauses, we must address coordinating con-
junctions and parallel clauses. A coordinating conjunction is a conjunction that connects
two clauses that are able to stand alone, i.e., two main clauses.
Here are some examples in English:
280

Dependent Clauses: Subordinate and Relative Clauses
I am here and I am glad to see you.
You are grateful for this job, or you are a spoiled brat.
Commas are generally optional in English, whereas they used more often in German.
Here are the common coordinating conjunctions one would find in German:
German    English
aber                                                                                                                     but, nevertheless, however
denn                                                                                                                     for, because (rarely used in spoken German; not to be confused with weil)
oder                                                                                           or
sondern  but rather
und                                                                                            and
As coordinating conjunctions connect two independent clauses, they do not affect word-
order in the two clauses. The first clause is often separated from the second with a comma
- especially if it is a long or complicated clause - after which follows the coordinating
conjunction and the second clause.
Here are some examples in German:
Ich hasse und ich liebe, und ich weiß nicht warum.                                             (Odi et amo - Catullus)
Ich bin nicht jung, aber ich bin froh.
There are two more constructions to be aware of:  entweder/oder and weder/noch, which
correspond to "either/or" and "neither/nor", respectively.
Entweder bist du mit uns gemeinsam, oder du bist unser Feind.
Entweder/oder and weder/noch can also be employed to contrast two items as well as clauses.
Note how "entweder" functions as an adverb.
English speakers should take note of the difference between aber and sondern, both of which
can be translated directly as "but". Aber means "however". Sondern means "rather". Many
other languages make this distinction.
Coordinating conjunctions are rather straightforward, and the number of coordinating con-
junctions is few.
80.6 Dependent Clauses: Subordinate and Relative Clauses
80.6.1 Introduction
Subordinate and relative clauses introduce information regarding the main clause that
needs to be expressed as a separate clause. They are collectively called "dependent clauses"
281

Sentences
because they are unable to stand by themselves as independent clauses.  Usually, subor-
dinate and relative clauses occupy a part of the main clause that was not fully explained;
subordinate clauses tend to fulfill more abstract missing sentence elements than relative
clauses do. Here are a few examples in English:
Subordinate Clauses:
I know that you are unhappy.
We came because it was your birthday.
We came because we knew that you were having a rough time.
This last example has two subordinate clauses: because we knew and that you were having
a rough time.
Subordinate clauses are usually set off by a subordinating conjunction, such as that, because,
when, if, and so on. In English, it is sometimes possible to omit the subordinating conjunc-
tion, specifically that, resulting in sentences such as, "I know you are unhappy," which is
perfectly acceptable in English. Such an option does not exist in German.
Relative Clauses:
I know the person to whom you were talking (who you were talking to).
God helps those who help themselves.
You are the person that got hit by the fly-ball at the game on Saturday.
Relative clauses relate one element of a clause to another clause by way of a relative pronoun.
The system of relative pronouns in German is considerably more extensive than that of
English.
In German, both subordinate clauses and relative clauses affect syntax, in most cases by
moving the conjugated verb to the end of the clause. Both subordinate clauses and relative
clauses are set off by a comma in German, which can frequently be omitted in English.
We should now examine the two types of clauses in greater detail, and then return to their
syntax.
80.6.2 Subordinate Clauses
Subordinate clauses are always set off by a comma, and begin with a subordinating con-
junction. Here is a list of all subordinating conjunctions in German. Note how all of them
answer a question presumably introduced in the main clause:

Furthermore, all interrogative (question) words, such as wie, wann, wer,                       and wo,                             and
wo-compounds, may be used as subordinating conjunctions. For example:
Ich weiß nicht, wohin er gegangen ist.                                                         (I don't know where he went.)
Ich weiß nicht, wie das Fest sich entwickelt hat.                                              (I don't know how the party
turned out)
Ich weiß nicht, warum er dir so böse ist.                                                      (I don't know why he is so mad at
you.)
Subordinate clauses provide information missing in the main clause. Consider the previous
two examples.  In both cases, the subordinate clause answered the question, "what?", or
what would have been the accusitive object. Other subordinate clauses provide information
that would otherwise have been provided by one of the several parts of speech.
Er hat mich geschlagen, als meine Frau im Klo war.                                             (He hit me when my wife was
in the bathroom.)
In this example, the subordinate clause, set off by the conjunction, "als", answers the
question, "when?", which would otherwise be answered adverbially.
The syntax regarding subordinate clauses will be discussed later. At this point, a property
of subordinate clauses that is not altogether shared with relative clauses should be pointed
out.  Subordinate clauses are themselves parts of speech for the main clause, and to a
limited extent can be treated as such.  Consider the following two sentences, which are
equivalent:
Ich darf in Kanada bleiben, solange wir noch verheiratet sind.
Solange wir noch verheiratet sind, darf ich in Kanada bleiben.
283

Sentences
Note how, in the second sentence, the subordinate clause occupied the first position, im-
mediately followed by the conjugated verb.  In reality, the use of subordinate clauses as
parts of speech integrated into the main clause is limited; they are, for aesthetic reasons,
restricted to the first position and to following the main clause. At both times they are set
off from the main clause by a comma.
Indem..., ist x passiert.  This subordinating conjunction accomplishes the same functions
as the English construction, "by [do]ing something..., x happened."
Indem er die Tür offen gelassen hat, hat er auch die Räuber ins Haus
eingelassen.
By leaving the door open, he let the robbers into the house.
By requiring a subject in the clause, the German construction is less susceptible to ambiguity
than English is; consider the sentence, "by leaving the door open, the robbers were able to
enter the house," which is lacking an agent for the door being left open, even though such
a construction is common in spoken English.
This section must make note of the differences between the words, als, wenn, and wann, all
of which can mean "when" in English.
Als refers to a single event or condition in the past, usually expressed using the preterite
tense.
Als du mich anriefst, war ich noch nicht zu Hause.                                               (When you called me, I was
not yet home.)
Wann is the interrogative word for "when".  It's use as a subordinating conjunction is
limited to indirect questions and immediate temporal events.
Ich weiß nicht, wann er nach Hause kommen wird.
Wenn is the most versatile of the three, and has several other meanings beyond its temporal
meaning. In the temporal space wenn describes, events are less recognized, or focuses on a
condition, rather than an event.
Finally, "wenn" has one other principal function.  It also means, "if", and is used in
conditional and subjunctive statements.
Wenn ich einmal reich wär', ... (If i were ever rich...)
We will return to syntax later.
80.6.3 Relative Clauses
In many ways, a relative clause is a lengthy description of an item in the main clause.
Minimally, a relative clause takes a part of speech from the main clause, known as the
284

antecedent and uses it in the dependent clause. What connects the two is a relative pronoun.
As should already be published in this book, the following declension table is provided:

Relative pronouns are similar to the definite article, with the exceptions of the dative plural
and the genitive case being marked in bold.
Note that the distinctions between "that" and "which"; and "that" and "who" in English do
not exist in German, where everything is described with a standard set of relative pronouns
with no regard to how integral the qualities described in the relative clause are to the
antecedent.
As relative clauses take one item from the main clause and use it in some way in a dependent
clause, it is important to consider how relative pronouns work to avoid confusion. All words
in German possess gender, number (singular or plural), and case.  The main clause, as it
relates to the antecedent, determines the gender and number of the relative pronoun; the
relative clause determines its case.
In order to use relative clauses successfully, it is critical that this point be understood.
Gender and number are "inherent" to the antecedent; no grammatical agent could conceiv-
ably change those properties. The relative pronoun's case is determined by its role in the
relative clause, i.e., how it relates to the other parts of speech in the clause. Consider the
following examples, all based on "the man", who is masculine and singular, and apparently
not well-liked.
Case of Relative Pronoun    Example
Nominative                                                                                        Der Mann, der nach Hause allein ging, ...
The man, who went home alone, ...
Accusitive                                                                                        Der Mann, den mein Freund während der Hochzeit
schlug, ...
The man, whom my friend punched at the wedding, ...
Dative                                                                                            Der Mann, dem meine Mutter kein Weihnachts-
geschenk gegeben hat, ...
The man, to whom my mother didn't give a Christ-
mas present, ...
Genitive                                                                                          Der Mann, dessen Tochter arbeitslos ist, ...
The man, whose daughter is unemployed, ...
In each of these examples, the gender and number of the relative pronoun were determined
by the antecedent, while the case of the relative pronoun was determined by its role in
the relative clause.  Note particularly the genitive example, wherein the relative pronoun,
meaning whose, modified a feminine noun, without his gender being affected.
285

Sentences
Whenever you construct a relative clause, be mindful of this rule.  Don't confuse yourself
with its complexity, especially regarding the genitive case. As discussed in the chapter on
personal pronouns, the word "whose", as well as other possessive pronouns such as "my",
"your", and so forth, is a pronoun and not an adjective. The pronoun always expresses the
characteristics of its antecedent, viz., gender and number.
Relative pronouns offered within prepositional phrases are perfectly acceptable:
Der Mann, mit dem meine Mutter wieder gestritten hat, ...
The man, with whom my mother argued again, ...
However,  if  the  antecedent  is  not  a  person,  and  the  relative  pronoun  falls  within  a
prepositional phrase, a wo-compound is frequently substituted:
Das Flugzeug, worin ich nach Seattle geflogen bin, war fast kaputt.
The airplane, in which I flew to Seattle, was almost broken.
Relative clauses almost invariably follow the item that they are modifying or the main
clause as a whole (with the gender and number of the relative pronoun indicating - to
some extent - which potential antecedent it is referring to).  Very rarely do they precede
the main clause. Exceptions to this come in the form of aphorisms and proverbs:
Der (oder Wer) heute abend ruhig einschläft, bekommt morgen Eiskrem und Keks.
(He who goes to bed quietly tonight will get ice-cream and cookies tomorrow
- something a mother might say to her children.)
This usage is relatively unimportant.
One final property of relative clauses should be discussed.  Relative clauses in some way
describe their antecedent.  The rules governing attributes in German are considerably
more flexible than in English, because the German case system reduces ambiguity.  This
allows the German speaker to turn a relative clause into an extended attribute, which is
essentially a long adjective. Compare the following two sentences, which are equivalent:
Der Mann, der jede Woche auf Dienstreise nach Seattle fährt, ist krank.
The man, who drives to Seattle every week on business, is sick.
Der jede Woche nach Seattle auf Dienstreise fahrende Mann ist krank.
The to-Seattle-every-week-on-business driving man is sick.
Such a construction is ludicrious in English, but not-uncommon in German.  The experi-
enced reader of German will, with practice, be able to read through such an item without
difficulty.
It would be best to review what we have learned about subordinate and relative pronouns
before discussing their syntax. Dependent clauses - both subordinating and relative clauses
- modify or in some other way describe the antecedent clause upon which they are based.
Subordinating clauses provide a variety of ways in which new information can relate to
286

Dependent Clauses: Subordinate and Relative Clauses
the main clause, many of which are adverbial in nature (e.g., "weil/because", but not
"dass/that", which, in the examples above, replaced the accusitive object). Relative clauses
modify and describe entities already mentioned in the main clause. Generally speaking, only
subordinate clauses have the ability to occupy the first position in a main clause.
Format:
Main clause, subordinating conjunction + subordinate clause.
Subordinating conjunction + subordinate clause, conjugated verb + main clause.
Main clause including antecedent, relative pronoun based on antecedent +
relative clause.
80.6.4 Syntax of Dependent Clauses
Subordinate and relative clauses have similar syntax.  Indeed, neglecting the verbs, they
have a syntax similar to main clauses. Recall the syntax described at the beginning of this
chapter. That syntax will form the basis of the Mittelfeld in dependent clauses.

Once again, no dependent clause will contain each of these elements. But understanding the
position of pronouns is critical. The same conventions listed under the main clause schema
apply.
Verbs in Dependent Clauses
The way the verbs are arranged depends on the number of verbs in the verb-phrase, and
the presence of a modal verb.
Dependent Clauses with One Verb
This is the simplest case. Such a clause has one verb, conjugated based on the person and
number of the subject of the sentence.  This conjugated verb is placed at the end of the
clause.
Subordinate Clause    Du weißt, dass ich dich liebe. (You know that I love you.)
Relative Clause                                                                                 Er ist ein Mann, der oft Berlin besucht. (He is a man who
often visits Berlin.)
Dependent Clauses with Two Verbs
A clause with two verbs has one conjugated verb and one verb in the infinitive.  Such
examples are clauses in a perfect tense (wherein the conjugated verb is the auxiliary verb,
either "haben" or "sein"), the future tense ("werden"), ones with modal verbs, and ones
with modal-like verbs (sehen, hören, helfen, lassen).
In a main clause, the conjugated verb will be in the second position, and the infinitive verb
will be at the end of the clause.
In a dependent clause, both verbs will be at the end of the clause, with the conjugated verb
last. This supports the principle of "building inwards".
Subordinate Clause    Du weißt, dass ich dich nicht lieben kann. (You know that I
cannot love you.)
Relative Clause                                                                                 Er ist ein Mann, der nach seiner absolvierten Prüfung Berlin
besuchen wird. (He is a man who will visit Berlin after his
graduation exam.)
Dependent Clauses with Three Verbs
Sentences with three verbs typically involve a modal verb, whose presence complicates
matters terribly. Let us think of some examples in English.
288

Infinitive Clauses
1) I am not able to help you move your car. - können - helfen - bewegen
2) I will be able to go to the store with you. - werden - können - gehen
3) I have not been able to afford that. (haben + "sich (dat) etw. leisten können" = to be
able to afford sth.)
4) I have not been able to reach you over the phone. - haben - können - erreichen
And so on.  The problem is, after you've learned how to put your verb at the end of the
sentence in a main clause, and after you've learned how to "build inwards" in dependent
clauses, and after you've pulled your hair out, night after night, sitting in a cafe in Seattle
declining relative pronouns, German grammar throws yet another rule at you, this one so
pointless and downright counter-productive, and it seems like German grammar is simply
making fun of you at this point, that you leap out of your seat, scream "woo hoo!", and
then get back to work.
The modal verb (or the modal-like verb) has to be at the end of the verb phrase, regardless
of whether it has been conjugated. In cases where it has not, the conjugated verb moves to
the beginning of the verb phrase. Let's look at our examples above.
Du weißt, dass...
1) ...ich dir dein Auto nicht bewegen helfen kann.  This one is straightforward, because
the modal verb is the conjugated verb, allowing the clause to follow the "build inwards"
principle.
2) ...ich zum Markt mit dir nicht werde gehen können. The modal verb must come last. No
semantic or logical reason for this.
3) ...ich mir das nicht habe leisten können. The modal verb must come last. Note here that
the modal verb does not form a past participle when it has main verb to modify.
4) ...ich dich am Telefon nicht habe erreichen können. Note the somewhat sensible placement
of "nicht".
And so...

80.7 Infinitive Clauses
The reader is already familiar with several types of German verbs that require other verbs;
these verbs are modal verbs (können, dürfen, wollen, etc.); modal-like verbs (sehen, hören,
helfen, lassen); auxilliary verbs (sein, haben), used for the perfect tenses; and werden, used
289

Sentences
for future and passive constructions.  Another verb that can take another verb without
forming an infinitive clause is bleiben (e.g., stehenbleiben, to remain standing). These verbs
never form infinitive clauses, and the verbs that are used with them go at the end of the
sentence.
Infinitive clauses are another kind of clause found in German, and are equivalent to
infinitive clauses in English. Consider the following examples in English:
I am here (in order) to help you clean your house.
The car is ready to be driven.
I work to be able to afford my car.
Infinitive clauses are formed after verbs that do not regularly take other verbs.  They
indicate purpose, intent, and meaning of the action in the main clause. As such, infinitive
clauses have no subject, or no nouns in the nominative case. Here are the above examples
in German:
Ich bin hier, um dir dein Haus putzen zu helfen.
Das Auto ist bereit, gefahren zu werden.
Ich arbeite, um mir ein Auto leisten zu können.
Infinitive clauses are usually found after a main clause, though it is possible for them to
occupy the first position of a main clause. They are always set off by a comma.
Of particular interest is the construction, "um...zu..."", which corresponds to the English
construction, "in order to...".  Um is placed at the beginning of the clause, after which
follows a standard infinitive clause. Whereas "in order" is frequently omitted from English
infinitive clauses of this sort, "um" is always included such clauses in German.
The Mittelfeld follows the standard syntax of main clauses, though without nominative
nouns and pronouns. At any rate, infinitive tend to be rather short.
Verbs (in the infinitive form) always come at the end, immediately preceded by the word
zu. In the case of separable-prefix verbs, such a verb is written as one word, with the word
zu between the prefix and the main verb; e.g. anzuschlagen, auszugehen, abzunehmen, and
so forth.
The syntax of infinitive clauses can thus be summarized as follows:

81 Verbs
81.1 Verbs
German verbs can be classified as weak or as strong. Weak verbs are very regular in their
forms, whereas strong verbs change the stem vowel.
Weak:
kaufen, kaufte, gekauft
Strong:
singen, sang, gesungen
With its Anglo-Saxon origin, this notion is also present in English.
flip, flipped, flipped
sing, sang, sung
Some German verbs have weak and strong forms. This may depend on meaning:
Der Botschafter wurde nach Berlin gesandt.
Der Süddeutsche Rundfunk sendete ein Konzert aus dem Gasteig.
Or on transitive vs. intransitive use:
Das Hemd hing auf der Wäscheleine.
Sie hängte das Hemd auf die Wäscheleine.

81.5.7 Use in Perfect (and Pluperfect) Tense
Although all these modals have a normal perfect:
gedurft gekonnt gemocht gemusst gesollt
in connection with other verbs, the infinitive form is used:
Ich habe das tun dürfen - können - mögen - müssen - sollen.
Wrong:
Ich habe das tun gedurft - gekonnt - gemocht - gemusst - gesollt.
It holds also for the verbs sehen and hören:
308

Present Tense
Ich habe ihn kommen sehen - hören.
81.5.8 Use of modal verbs as full verbs
Modal verbs can be used as full verbs indicating motion.
Er muss nach Berlin He must go to Berlin.
81.6 Present Tense
81.6.1 Use
The Present Tense is used for..
• The Present Tense (="das Präsens") is used to describe situations that are happening
and aren't the past.
• For Ongoing Action, like I'm swimming in the pool now
• Everyday Truths, like The moon and stars will come at night.
• Future meaning, if explicitly stated, like I will run tomorrow morning
• Actions started in the past and still going on in the present I've been cleaning the house
all day
81.6.2 Progressive Forms
There is a present progressive tense in colloquial spoken German. Its use is optional.
Here is one example:
Ich bin am Fahren. (I am at the driving) I'm driving.
The person to say this would be driving during the time they say this and they would
continue to drive after stating this for some time.
You nominalize the verb ("fahren" (driving) becomes "das Fahren") and add a "am". You
can also do this with forms of the past.
Als er kam war ich gerade am Abwaschen. (When he arrived i was at "the dishwashing") I
was washing the dishes when he arrived.
So the verb "sein" (to be) includes the information what tense he was doing what he did
in.
309

Verbs
Here the progressive meaning is also emphasized with the word "gerade" meaning something
like: I was JUST ABOUT to wash the dishes(not the same though because it means he is
already doing it and not about to start).
81.7 Perfect Tense
The Perfect Tense or das Perfekt of verbs is used to talk about things in the past which
have already happened.  It is sometimes referred to as "Present Perfect Tense".  This can
cause confusion. While the formation is similar, the meaning and usage differs.
81.7.1 Formation
As in English, the perfect tense consists of two parts.  An auxiliary (Hilfsverb) and a
past participle (Partizip Perfekt).  Compare the examples given below with their English
translations.
Er                                                                                          hat                                        gelacht.
He                                                                                          has                                        laughed.

She                                                                                         has                                        come.
Die Kinder                                                                                  haben                                      gegessen.

                                                                                            81.7.2 Past participle for regular verbs
The general rule is simple:
verb                                                                                        prefix                                     + 3rd-person sing.    participle(er/sie/es)
lachen (laugh)                                                                              ge                                         + (er/sie/es) lacht   gelacht
kaufen (buy)                                                                                ge                                         + (er/sie/es) kauft   gekauft
mähen (mow)                                                                                 ge                                         + (er/sie/es) mäht    gemäht
There are some groups of regular verbs that slightly differ from that pattern.
Some verbs drop the prefix ge-. Like the other regular verbs they end in -t. These are:
1. Verbs with unseparable prefixes (be-, ent-, er-, empf-, ge-, ver-, miss-, zer-)
Examples:
verb                                                                                        past participle
besuchen (visit)                                                                            besucht

2. Verbs ending in -ieren
Examples:

3. Another group is formed by verbs with separable prefixes
With separable verbs, the prefix ge is placed between the prefix and the rest of the verb.
Examples:

81.7.3 Past Participle for Irregular Verbs
Irregular verbs always end in -en. The vowel can be different from the one in present
tense. Look at some examples:
infinitive                                                                                   3rd-person sg.                                                                past participle

311

Verbs
You have to learn these forms by heart. How you can obtain the necessary information and
how you should learn them is described in section tips for learning below.
Note that irregular verbs can be combined with the same prefixes as described above. The
same rules regarding the prefix ge- apply.  Therefore the forms for schreiben, verschreiben
and aufschreiben are geschrieben, verschrieben and aufgeschrieben respectively.
Which verbs are irregular
A lot of verbs that are irregular in English are irregular in German, too.  Unfortunately,
this is not always true. It is most likely when the German and the English verb are related
(i.e. look similar).
Examples:
see:                                                                                          irregular                                           sehen:    irregular
buy:                                                                                          irregular                                           kaufen:   regular
get:                                                                                          irregular                                                     bekommen: irregular ;-)
Regular verbs are much more frequent than irregular ones, but a lot of the irregular verbs
are used very frequently, for instance haben, sein, gehen, kommen etc.
When in doubt whether a verb is irregular or not, it is best to look it up in a dictionary
(See below).
81.7.4 Haben or sein as auxiliaries
Whether a verb is irregular or not does not influence the choice of auxiliary.
Most verbs take haben as auxiliary.
A) Verbs which take an accusative object (transitive verbs)
B) Reflexive verbs always take haben as auxiliary.
Examples A:
trinken: Er hat ein Bier getrunken.
lesen:                                                                                        Sie hat ein Buch gelesen
kochen                                                                                        Sie haben gestern Spaghetti gekocht.
Examples B:
sich freuen                                                                                   Ich habe mich gefreut
sich kämmen                                                                                   Er hat sich gekämmt
sich ärgern                                                                                   Wir haben uns schon lange nicht mehr so geärgert.
The auxiliary sein is taken by verbs that describe
312

Perfect Tense
C) the relocation from one place to another or
D) the change of a state
and with
E) sein (be) and bleiben (stay)
Note: none of the verbs from groups C-E is combined with an accusative object.
Examples C: relocation verbs

In southern German (mostly Bavarian) use, also stehen, sitzen und schwimmen are treated
like a (non-)movement:
Ich bin gestanden - gesessen - geschwommen. High German is: Ich habe gestanden
- gesessen - geschwommen.
Aber: Ich habe den See durchschwommen.

Exceptions to the rules Some of the verbs from group A can be used with an object in
accusative case. In this case, they take haben as auxiliary.

Ich habe das Auto (Akk.) nach Kalifornien gefahren. I drove the car to

The same applies to fliegen (fly), starten and reiten (ride a horse).

81.7.5 Usage
Unlike in English the difference in meaning between Perfekt and Präteritum is rather small.
The main difference between those two forms lies in usage. Perfekt is mostly used in spoken
language, while Präteritum is mostly reserved for written texts. However, the modals, the
verbs haben and sein and the expression es gibt are almost exclusively used in Präteritum -
even when speaking. One reason might be the frequency of those verbs, the other reason is
most likely the very complex perfect forms for modals.
(This is in southern German use; in northern German, you'll hear the preterite also in
spoken language.)
On the other hand, the perfect tense is used in writing too.  The more oral the text is,
the more perfect tense you will find (for example in personal letters etc.). If an action has
happened very recently, it tends to be in perfect tense too.
Look at the following conversation and concentrate on the distribution of Präteritum and
Perfekt.
(1) Anna: Hallo Peter. Wo warst du denn? Ich habe dich schon lange nicht mehr gesehen.
(2) Peter: Hallo Anna. Ich war die letzen zwei Wochen im Urlaub.
(3) Anna: So? Wo warst du denn genau?
(4) Peter: Auf der Insel Elba, in einem fantastischen Hotel. Es gab jeden Abend ein Büffet
und man konnte essen, so viel man wollte!
(5) Anna (lacht): Ich glaube dir sofort, dass dir das gefallen hat.  Du hast aber nicht nur
gegessen, oder? Was hast du denn den ganzen Tag gemacht?
(6) Peter (lacht auch): Nein, natürlich nicht. Ich bin viel geschwommen, ich habe mir die
Insel angeguckt und am Abend bin ich immer zum Tanzen in eine Disco gegangen.
(7) Anna: Aha... Und? Hast du jemanden kennen gelernt?
(8) Peter (grinst): Kein Kommentar.

81.7.6 How to find the forms in a dictionary
Unless you have a special dictionary for learners, not all the forms will be spelled out.
Regular forms are often omitted.  The same goes for the auxiliary haben.  If no forms are
indicated, you may assume that the verb is regular and has the verb haben as an auxiliary.
However, if you find the abbreviation itr or i. (for intransitive) behind the verb, the auxiliary
is often sein.  Intransitve verbs don't have an accusative object and these are often used
with sein, while transitive verbs (tr. or t.) are always conjugated with haben.
Sometimes not even the forms of irregular verbs are given in the lexicon entry.  Irregular
verbs are often indicated by irr. for irregular or a similar abbreviation. In that case, look
for a list of irregular verb forms in the index of your dictionary.
To find the past participle of separable verbs you often have to cut the prefix and look
for the base form of the verb.  If you look for aufstehen (get up), you probably find your
answer in the entry of stehen. Remember: The prefix ge goes in between the prefix of the
separable verb and the verb itself: auf + ge + standen.
When working online, you might consider using  Canoo1.  Enter an arbitrary form of the
word you are interested in into the mask. Hit enter. On the results page, choose the link
Flexion behind the appropriate entry (or inflection in the English version). You will get a
table of all possible verb forms.
81.7.7 Tips for learning
Irregular forms are just that - irregular.  Therefore you have to learn them by heart.  By
learning four forms, you can construct every verb form for a given verb.
The forms you should know are:

All forms - besides the infinitive of course - should be in 3rd-person singular.
A good way to learn those forms is to put them on small cards. On one side you write the
infinitive and probably a sentence to illustrate the usage of the verb. On the backside you
put the rest of the forms and - if needed - a translation of the verb.  When learning, you
look at the infinitve and try to remember the forms and the meaning. You can easily verify
your hypothesis by flipping the card.
If you encounter a verb you want to learn, look it up in a dictionary. If it is irregular, learn
the verb together with its defining forms. Like that, you spare yourself a lot of trouble later
on.
81.8 Sentence Structure
The perfect tense consists of two verb forms: an auxiliary and a past participle. Together
they form the so called predicate. The predicate consists of all verb parts in one clause.
The sentence structure in perfect behaves as with every two parts predicate (modals plus
infinitive, separable verbs etc.)
81.8.1 Main Clauses
In a main clause (Hauptsatz), the conjugated verb (the auxiliary in this case) is in the
second position and the past participle stands at the end of the clause.
First Position (I)                                                                                    (II)
1) Sein Vater                                                                                         hat  gestern ein fantastisches Essen gekocht.
2) Gestern                                                                                            hat  sein Vater ein fantastisches Essen gekocht.
Both: Yesterday, his father cooked a fantastic meal.
3) Ein fantastisches Essen  hat  sein Vater gestern gekocht.*
It was a fantastic meal that his father cooked yesterday.
* The third example is correct, although not very frequent. You might use it if you want to stress
what exactly his father has prepared or if you have to repeat the sentence because your partner has
not understood this particular part of it.
Second position does not equal second word, as you can see above. However, there is only
one group of words allowed before the conjugated verb (the auxiliary in this case).  Such
316

Past tense
groups of words are called "phrases". While you can put very long phrases in front of the
conjugated verb, you must not use two. Therefore the sentence "Gestern sein Vater hat ein
fantastisches Essen gekocht" is wrong.
81.8.2 Subordinated Clauses
Subordinated clauses begin with a subordinating conjunction. Well known conjunctions of
this kind are
weil  dass  wenn.
*In spoken language weil is often used like und or aber, which means that it is followed by a main
clause.  However, after weil, speakers often pause for a little while.  There is no pause after either
und or aber.
Weil + main clause is not allowed in written language.  Therefore you may say:  Ich gehe, weil -
(little pause) - ich bin müde. But you wouldn't use it in a letter. At least not yet.
The correct conjunction for a main clause is denn, which is rarely used in spoken language.
In subordinated clauses the conjugated verb, i.e.  the auxiliary, stands at the very end of
the sentence. The past participle stands directly in front of it. For example:
                                                                                                         conj.      aux.                                     participle  aux.
Ich weiß,                                                                                                dass  du   das                                      gemacht                   hast.
Ich glaube dir,                                                                                          weil  du                                            bisher noch nie gelogen   hast.
Ich glaube dir,                                                                                                     denn  du hast bisher noch nie gelogen.
Ich gehe,                                                                                                wenn  du                                            gegangen                  bist.
81.9 Past tense
81.9.1 Regular verbs
Regular (or better, weak) verbs take the ending -te. The person endings are added after-
wards. Note that the forms for 1st- and 3rd-person singular are the same.

Verbs
If the stem of a verb (infinitive minus -en) ends in -t (arbeit-en), -d (end-en) or consonant
plus m or n (öffn-en, rechn-en) you add an -e before the preterite endings.
arbeiten
ich                                                                                             arbeitete

81.9.2 Irregular verbs
Without -te
The strong verbs belong to this group.  The endings are easy to memorize.  It is harder
to know which vowel to use. The rule mentioned above for t/d, double-consonant + n/m
applies also for irregular verbs.
                                                                                                fahren        stehen
ich                                                                                             fuhr          stand

sie/Sie                                                                                         fuhren        standen
gehen, ging, gegangen
stehen, stand, gestanden
With -te
Few irregular verbs take the -te ending.  Examples are: nennen, rennen, kennen, bringen,
denken and the irregular modals (können, dürfen and müssen).
nennen
ich                                                                                             nannte

Future Tense
81.10 Future Tense
81.10.1 Talking about future with the present tense
German uses the Present Tense to talk about the future whenever it is clear to both
speaker and listener that the future is meant. In the dialogue example:
Wenn du zu Hause bleibst, kommen wir dich besuchen.
If you stay at home, we shall come and visit you.
The whole conversation is about the future, so there is no need to indicate it again in the
tense of the verb.
Some more examples:
Ich schreibe den Brief heute Abend.
I will write the letter this evening.
Wir gehen nächstes Jahr nach Spanien.
We will go to Spain next year.
81.10.2 Futur I
Where the meaning would not otherwise be clear, and in more formal language, e.g.  to
express an intention, German talks about the future tense by                                  using   werden plus the
infinitive at the end of the clause. The forms of werden are:
ich werde
du wirst
er/sie/es/man wird
wir werden
ihr werdet
sie/Sie werden
Examples:
Ich werde ein Haus bauen.
I shall build a house. (an intention)
Wir werden sehen.
We will see.
The future can also express some inescapable fate:
Sie werden alle umkommen.
They will all perish.
319

Verbs
81.10.3 Future II
The Future II is formed with added "sein" oder "haben" and expresses that one action will
happen before another one.
Wenn sie das Abendessen gekocht haben wird, werden sie kommen.
When she will have cooked the dinner, they will come.
In the colloquial language, the perfect is often used for that.
In the colloquial language expresses the Future II often a speculation about the past.
Sie werden angekommen sein.
literally "they will have arrived" - meaning "(I gather) they have arrived (by
now)"
Sie werden es gemacht haben.
"they will have done it"
In the colloquial language, the Futur II is normally used when speaking about something
that should have happened already, but you are not sure or you can't prove it.

Wie geht es Ihnen? How are you (formal)? How are you doing?
Wie geht's                                                                                    How are you (informal)

Bis dann!                                                                                     Later! (until whenever)
Wiederhören                                                                                   (hear) again (used over the phone)
Note: How are you? is not a typical query in German greeting etiquette as it is in English,
where the standard answer is I'm Fine.  A German speaker will consider this to be an
earnest question, and you may receive an honest answer that is longer than you expected.
Note: Wiedersehen directly translates as "to see again".

86.2.2 Genitive case personal pronouns
The genitive case corresponds to the possessive case in English or to the English objective
case preceded by 'of' and denoting possession. The use of genitive personal pronouns is very
rare in German and many Germans are unable to use them correctly.
                                                                                                                 Singular    Plural

Examples:
Ich erbarme mich eurer. ˜ I take pity on you(rs).
meinerunbedeutenden Meinung nach. ˜ in my humble opinion (IMHO)

The personal pronouns in the dative case are used as indirect objects of verbs and after
the prepositions aus, außer, bei, mit, nach, seit, von, zu.
                                                                                                                 Singular                     Plural

87.1 Conjugating 'to be'
Ich bin groß.                                                                                      I am tall.
Du bist sehr groß.                                                                                 You are very tall.
Sie ist klein.                                                                                     She is short.
Sie sind groß.                                                                                     They are tall.
In these cases, we use the correct form of sein for each situation. Please notice the final two
sentences both use 'Sie', and we must look at the verb to determine the difference between
'she' and 'they'.
In German, the English infinitive 'to be' is translated as sein.
This is the table of the forms of 'sein', with rough English translations. Note that in English,
there are only three forms (am, is, are) while German has five (bin, bist, ist, sind, seid).
Also, the verb conjugation of the two you-formals are always the exact same.

In each of these sentences, we use an irregular verb. Irregularity occurs in the ich-form or
the du-form and er/sie/es-forms. There are three types of irregularity.

Conjugating Irregular Verbs
87.3.1 E in the first syllable
One form of irregularity occurs sometimes when the verb contains an 'e' in the first syllable.
The change is simple: the du-form and er/sie/es forms both change the 'e' to an 'i.e.'  or
an 'i'. Two common examples are shown. Note that the er/sie/es-form and ihr-form are no
longer the same.
sehen - to see

87.3.2 Haben
A similar, yet different, change occurs in the verb "haben".                                     As in the irregularity above,
the du-form and er/sie/es-form change.

87.3.3 Verbs ending in Consonant-N
Some verbs change the ich-form for obvious reasons.  "Wandern" and "basteln" are two
examples. Both drop the first e in the ich-form.
wandern - to hike

Modals are a new kind of verb. They are the equivalent to helping verbs in English. There
are seven basic modals:  können (can), mögen (like), dürfen (may), wollen (want), sollen
(should), müssen (must), and möchten (would like). Möchten isn't technically a modal, but
it acts like one in most aspects.
Modals are conjugated very differently.  The ich-form and er/sie/es-form are always alike
and singular has a different verb in the first syllable (except in sollen and möchten). Below
are the conjugations of the six basic modals and möchten.

Du siehst schön aus!                                                                          You look good!
Ich muss mein Zimmer aufräumen.
                                                                                              I have to clean my room.
Komm mit!                                                                                     Come with!
Probier diese Jeans an!                                                                       Try these jeans on.
Some verbs in German are separable:  they have a prefix that can be separated from the
base. When the verb is used with a modal, it regains the prefix at the end of the sentence.
When it is the main verb of the sentence, the prefix is moved to the end of the sentence.
An "example" in English would be the word "intake". When it is used as a verb, it becomes
"take ... in". When it is used as an adjective or a noun, it becomes "intake" again.
Two easy examples of separable verbs are aussehen and mitkommen. Note that aussehen is
also irregular.
aussehen - to appear

90 A.08 - False Friends
There are some words which are spelled the same in English and in German, but have
completely different meanings.  Even though the words are spelled the same, they are
usually pronounced completely differently.  It can sometimes be dangerous to use these
words (for both native English speakers and native German speakers.) Think of that, next
time someone wants to give you a " Gift1" or opens a door and says " After2 you!"
Note: This list contains some items of  etymological3 interest. For example, the transfor-
mation of the consonant 't' in German to 'd' in English in word pairs like Bart->Beard,
Bett->Bed, Gut->Good, Hart->Hard, Rot->Red, and Not->Need.
